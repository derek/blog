<blockquote>
"This is a video that apppears to be castmembers from Walt Disney World horsing around in character costumes -- Belle performing a striptease, Tweedledee and Tweedledum administering a beatdown to Pooh, and so forth. Pretty mild stuff, and reasonably funny. Mostly notable for the fact that the characters, especially the "head" characters are pretty sacrosanct when they're onstage. <a href="http://www.radarmagazine.com/magazine/wildkingdom7.mov">5MB Quicktime Link</a>."</blockquote>
