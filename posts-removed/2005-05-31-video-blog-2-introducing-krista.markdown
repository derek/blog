Meet Krista... my parent's golden retriever.  I shot this when we first got her, when she was probably 10 weeks old.  Most parents record and cherish their childs first words, their first steps, first day at school.  Well here we got Krista's first "accident" in the house and first fart.  She also learns that when you eat something, it dissapears.  Takes her a little while to figure out though.

Enjoy.
