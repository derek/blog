	<li><a href="http://almaer.com/blog/running-ruby-in-the-browser-via-script-typetextruby" target="_blank">Ruby comes to the browser</a> - Looks like some folks have been able to integrate ruby scripting into the web browser, which opens up a whole new world if it actually catches on and matures.  Personally, I like Javascript, a lot, but there are some things with it that I think can be improved on.  Mainly, it's syntax can sometimes be backwards thinking when compared to a crisp and well thought out OO language like Ruby.  I doubt anything major will come of Ruby as a browser scripting language, but the concept is cool and it can do nothing but help out the web development world, so I'm excited to see what happens with it.  If you can soon do &lt;script type="text/ruby"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;, I wonder how far off &lt;script type="text/php"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt; is?</li>
