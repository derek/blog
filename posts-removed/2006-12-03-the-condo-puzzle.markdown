Because I'm pretty much custom designing my new condo, it's been pretty crazy trying to piece together everything I need, and want.  So far though I've managed to get quite a few of the essentials purchased over the last week.

First up... my new baby, a Philips 42pf9431d, translated a 42" Plamsa TV.  I've been glued to my couch over the last day since getting it watching movies and sports in HD, this thing is gorgeous.

Next up... my new bedroom set that I got a great deal on during the thanksgiving sales.

And my most recent purchase was my refrigerator

Can't wait to move in!
