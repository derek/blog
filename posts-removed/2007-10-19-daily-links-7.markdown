	<li><a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/help/wordpress_quickstart" target="_blank">Feedburner + Wordpress how-to</a> - With my recently upgraded blog, figured it was time to hook it up through feedburner.  So, if you like want to use RSS to read my blog, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/derekgathright/KQZs" target="_blank">subscribe to my feed</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=qhCmlGd_3BGyOAK1EpPZnA" target="_blank">My Lifestream Pipe</a> - I created what is essentially an aggregator for all my personal RSS feeds (blogs, microblogs, Netflix, Flickr, Picasaweb, etc...) and ran them all through a filter with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo Pipes</a>.  While it appears to be somewhat buggy (varying results every run), it's still pretty cool. I love yahoo pipes!  At first I didn't quite "get it" but knew the potential was there, but now it's so easy to use and a very intuitive concept.</li>
