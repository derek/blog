So I threw down the deposit today for my new pad in downtown Kansas City and can't wait to move in.  It's the Waltower building at 9th &amp; Walnut.  I had the choices between a mid-level 1 bedroom, or a 2 bedroom/2 bath penthouse for $80 more, too good to pass up.

The new place is two blocks away from the new library (which is awesome) and 2 1/2 blocks away from the main building (Library Lofts) which has all my amenities; pool, fitness center, jacuzzi, sauna, tanning bed, clubhouse, pool table, putting green.

So I'm on the top level and the closest 3 of 5 sections are mine.

Unfortunately, Penthouse-polooza doesn't begin until July 22nd.  Gonna be tough to have to wait two months.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-424" title="Waltowers-Interior-Entrance" src="http://www.derekville.net/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/Waltowers-Interior-Entrance.gif" alt="Waltowers-Interior-Entrance" width="118" height="173" />
