I realized I hadn't yet picked up the latest She Wants Revenge album, so I figured this would be a good chance to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sd_allcat_dmusic/105-4166190-5758859?ie=UTF8&amp;node=163856011" target="_blank">Amazon's new MP3 store</a>.  15 non-DRM'd 256kbps tracks for $8.99 is a steal IMO.  Thank god there is a place for someone like me to buy music now. I listen to my music on a variety of non-ipod devices, so anything with DRM isn't really an option for me. While iTunes won't be going away anytime soon, Apple is already <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/17/apple_itunes_plus/" target="_blank">feeling the effects</a> and is realizing their monopoly is just about over.

Anyways, only a couple songs into the album, but I like what I hear so far.  So check it out.
