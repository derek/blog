    With the Cardinals being so hot I dont think anyone in St. Louis would go to see the Blues anymore.

    Even when baseball isnt in session!

    Go Cardinals.

    Oh, and a bit off subject, but check this out:

    I thought it was quite funny.

    "Although defense attorney Brian Costello does not dispute that Haefele vomited on his teacher, he claims the May 23 incident was an accident."

    Haha.... That story is awesome.  Not only did this kid vomit on his teacher as a prank, but then he goes out an hires Brian Costello "The Rock 'n Roll Attorney" to represent him.

    If you read towards the bottom....

    "In 2003, John Carl Marques, who spit on a police officer, was charged with "placing bodily fluid upon a government employee," a felony that can carry a life sentence because of the possibility of transmitting a deadly disease."

    Life?!??

Has a nice ring to it eh?  Well the Star <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/11937803.htm">reports today</a> that Howard Baldwin (former owner of two NHL franchises) has expressed interest in buying the recently up for sale St. Louis Blues.  Can't say that I'm that big of a fan of hockey, in fact... I've enjoyed this last season more than most.  However, considering St. Louis stealing all the money for the east side of the state in recent years for new stadium after new stadium, I would have to say that stealing their hockey team in return would be great!

However, for that to happen, it's also noted that the lease to the Savvis Center would have to be bought as well, bringing the franchise pricetag to ~$140 Million.  Didn't the Mighty Ducks just sell for ~$80 Million?  With Pittsburgh and a few other teams on the market, I can't say the chances of this happening are likely, but damn it would be sweet! =)
