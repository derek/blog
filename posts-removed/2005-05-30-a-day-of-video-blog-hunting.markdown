Gearing up to start posting my own videos, so figured I'd spend some time checking out all the vlogs out there.


Here was a good one about <a href="http://www.michaelverdi.com/2005/01/youngest-videoblogger-in-world.html">"The worlds youngest vlogger"</a>

Turns out there is a new kid in town, here is <a href="http://jordanmakesvideos.blogspot.com/2005/05/i-will-love-you-forever.html">Jordan</a>  vlogging his day at the petting zoo.  Pretty good stuff.

Also, go check out <a href="http://philham.blogspot.com/">Phil Hamilton's</a> blog as it has some pretty good stuff in it.  <a href="http://philham.blogspot.com/2005/03/vlog-week-27-school-is-scamming-me.html">This one</a> cracked me up.

Why am I going to start a video blog?  Because I have an existing collection of everything from quality Spring Break clips, to burying a roomates car in snow, to beer tours, to goofy white guys singing Ice, Ice, Baby.  So, this should be fun.
