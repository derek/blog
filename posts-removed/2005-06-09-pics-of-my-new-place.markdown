    I cant tell by the pictures, but do you have hardwood floors?

    I'm sure it's a given in a loft in Downtown KC.

    If not you got served!

    Actually... it is finished concrete, which is still pretty nice.

    Hardwood floors would be sweet, and many of the nicer lofts I've seen downtown have them.  Too expensive right now though.

    Ouch! No drunken spills with ol bod over at Dereks.

    Although I'm sure I could tip a glass or two no problem!

Was able to get some pictures of my new place while I was downtown today <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/?p=19">(which I wrote about a few weeks ago)</a>.  Unfortunately, all I had was my camera phone on me, so the quality isn't that great.  The layout of the place might be a bit difficult to determine from the images, but basically it is a living room with an attached kitchen and a bedroom & bath on each side, totaling about 900 sq. ft.

You can find all the images <a href="http://moblog.derekgathright.com/">here</a>.
