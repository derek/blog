  <div class="entry-content"><p>Loic Lemuer (CEO of Seesmic) recently announced at Microsoft&rsquo;s Developer Conference that he&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2009/11/more-on-seesmics-vision-of-programmable-twitter-clients.html">releasing a new version of Seesmic</a> that supports plugins.  This is huge for developers, as well as users.</p>

<p>Up until now the Twitter developer ecosystem has been very closed.  Sure the Twitter APIs are as open as possible, but all the clients out there are largely closed platforms.  There are a few exceptions, including <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spaz/">Spaz</a> and <a href="http://github.com/drgath/tweenky/">Tweenky</a> (my client) which are open-source.  It is great to have a starting point (aside from raw libraries) that gives developers a place to start with when building a Twitter application.  With Seesmic Desktop invading Windows with a programmable version that you can write plugins for, this is a huge step that hopefully will push other developers/companies towards the same model.<br/>
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-600"></a>
When I launched Tweenky about 18 months ago, I hadn&rsquo;t event thought about making it programmable, but pretty quickly afterwards I realized the potential it could have if it were programmable, and so I began a rewrite, and coded it in 99% JavaScript with two plugins out of the box, Twitter and Identi.ca.  I had plans for other plugins (Facebook), but the problem with developing a platform, and not just an application, is that it takes a loooot of time.  For one guy working in his spare time, it just wasn&rsquo;t going to be possible to abstract out a platform and develop a community around it.  So, I started with another rewrite and only focused support for Twitter.  I still think it was the right move given the limited amount of time I can spend developing it.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m really waiting for is an easy way for Twitter developers to monetize their applications.  We&rsquo;ve all seen what the Apple has accomplished with the App Store and the ecosystem they created overnight.  While most iPhone developers have made very little, others have won the lottery and struck it rich.  While Twitter (the company) has been very supportive of the developer community, they should really look at giving it a push and figuring out a way to monetarily reward Twitter developers.  Nothing gets developers going like a big, fat, diamond crusted carrot dangling in front of their noses.  Afterall, Twitter wouldn&rsquo;t be Twitter if it weren&rsquo;t for the developers.  The various clients are what made the service usable for the hard-core Twitter users that create most of the valuable content.</p>

<p>P.S. You can still view the programmable version at <a href="http://beta.tweenky.com">beta.tweenky.com</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s my last day at Catholic Content.  It&rsquo;s been a great 3 year ride and is certainly going out with a bang.  When we started planning for NCYC 2009 (National Catholic Youth Conference) 18 months ago, I never would have guessed it would be my last weekend.  But here I am, working behind the scenes with the production crew to stream the event out to thousands of people around the world.  The fun part? I&rsquo;ve never done live event streaming before, so it&rsquo;s been a hectic, but adventurous weekend.  In a way, it&rsquo;s almost a culmination of the last three years.  Lots of stuff I&rsquo;ve never done before, but having a blast learning.</p>

<p>Coming into this job as the lead developer for MyCatholicVoice.com, I had zero experience running a project the size of where we have taken this.  I had never built a web server this size from scratch (software-wise).  But along the way, I&rsquo;ve had to tackle hundreds, or heck&hellip; likely thousands of problems along the way, and I&rsquo;ve learned something at every step.  It&rsquo;s been such an incredible learning experience as I&rsquo;ve gained a bit of knowledge about so many different areas.  These new skills include everything from cloud computing, systems architecture, to Linux administration, all the way to the front-end with JavaScript libraries.  Then of course, that middle layer of PHP where my skills and knowledge have improved an unmeasurable amount.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-594"></a>
When I started my career after graduation 5 years ago, I had a gameplan, a very iterative gameplan:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Get a job, anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Find a web development job, maybe it would be something that I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about or didn&#8217;t pay well, but it was at least enough to get me in the door as a programmer. </li>
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Find a job that paid a decent amount, but didn&#8217;t have to be a project I was passionate about.  </li>
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now that everything else is taken care of, find a project I was passionate about. </li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond those 4 steps, I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly what came next.  Perhaps it was starting my own company? Maybe moving out to the west coast?  Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t even in web development?  In fact, mid-step 3, I considered changing careers because my job was just so unfulfilling.  I enjoy cooking, so maybe Culinary school? Then I remembered I don&rsquo;t like anything outside 10 foods, so nevermind that.  I loved doing <a href="http://www.derekville.net/2005/06/06/high-school-animation-projects/">3D animations in high school</a>, but never pursued it because I can&rsquo;t draw.  So&hellip; I stuck it out and realized it was just my job, not my career choice, that was unsatisfying.  Boom.  Reenergized.</p>

<p>Well, tomorrow is the transition between from Step 4 to Step 5. This year I realized the next step for me was going to be moving to LA, SF, or Seattle.  I needed to get to a tech hub where there were thousands of jobs, with companies large &amp; small.  But, there was also something from this last step that I was missing, that &ldquo;passionate about the project&rdquo; part.  While I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the platform we&rsquo;ve built at MyCatholicVoice, I&rsquo;ve never been able to have much of a connection with our users.  Why?  I&rsquo;m a non-Catholic working on a Catholic project.  While I think the purpose of the project is a noble one and I agree with bringing &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; to the Catholic church, it ultimately doesn&rsquo;t effect me faith-wise.  That&rsquo;s a little bit of a bummer sometimes.  I want to be a user of the product, as well as a developer.</p>

<p>Well, enter Yahoo. Talking about being a user of a product&hellip; Y! is one of the oldest services I still use from my first days on the internet in the mid-90s.  Check out my <a href="http://www.derekville.net/2009/11/13/onward-and-upward/">last post</a> for all the reasons I&rsquo;m thrilled to have this opportunity.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s after what&rsquo;s next? Hmmm&hellip;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://s89997654.onlinehome.us/screencaps/yahoo_logo_design_1.jpg_%28JPEG_Image%2C_840x220_pixels%29-20110605-225717.jpg" alt="yahoo_purple_small.GIF" border="0" width="438" height="83" /></div>


<p>When I attended Yahoo&rsquo;s HackDay &lsquo;08 at their Sunnyvale headquarters, I was so impressed with the people, the event, the technology, and the culture at Yahoo, that I made working for Yahoo one of my career goals.  Well, it came a little sooner than I expected, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to say that starting Nov 23rd, 2009, I can scratch &ldquo;A career with Yahoo&rdquo; off my bucket list.</p>

<h2>Why Yahoo?</h2>


<p>There are a number of reasons why Yahoo is so appealing to me at this point in my career.</p>

<p><strong>The Scale</strong>: As a developer, there is a lot of satisfaction in knowing that millions of people are happily using your products.  With billions of pageviews per day across the Yahoo network of sites, there are only a handful of companies that can offer similar challenges as Yahoo (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and maybe a few others).  At Yahoo, I expect to learn what it takes to code and assemble massively scalable web applications.  Not many developers get a chance to work on products this large, and it is certainly an opportunity I find invaluable.</p>

<p><strong>The Collective</strong>: Yahoo employs roughly 15,000 people, and thousands of those are software engineers working on some of the largest products used on the web.  I&rsquo;m confident that whatever problems I may run into on a daily basis, there is someone at Yahoo that has the knowledge to help me out.  I can name dozens of current and former Yahoo employees that have inspired me in one way or another during my career, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll meet dozens more.</p>

<p><strong>The Products</strong>: Yahoo certainly has its fair-share of best of breed products on the internet.  The jewels are of course the Yahoo portal, Yahoo Mail, and Flickr.  Beyond that, there are some other very successful products throughout the years, including; Yahoo Games, GeoCities, Messenger, Music, Movies, News, and Sports.  All of which I&rsquo;ve used extensively at one point or another.  My first Yahoo account I created when I was 15, and I am now 28.  There&rsquo;s certainly a sense of pride and satisfaction knowing that I&rsquo;ve been a happy customer of my future employer for 13 years.</p>

<p><strong>The Culture</strong>: Yahoo puts an enormous amount of resources into their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/">Developer Network</a> and open-source technologies.  As an advocate of open-source software, it&rsquo;s a thrill to know I&rsquo;m working for a company that values it as much as I do.  It&rsquo;s a shame that some of the neatest tools Yahoo has to offer are still unknown or unused by many developers (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Pipes</a>, &amp; <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>), and I will certainly do my best to evangelize the incredible tools Yahoo has offered to the community.</p>

<p><strong>The Location</strong>: Having lived in/near Kansas City my whole life, I love it here, but between October and March sometimes you wish you could take a vacation to Hell just so you can warm up a little bit. I&rsquo;ve been to Southern California probably a dozen times throughout my life, and it doesn&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes of the ocean breeze, the palm trees, and the sunshine before you don&rsquo;t want to ever leave.</p>

<p>Since I signed the paperwork and this whole thing became a reality, it has certainly taken a while to sink in.  I still don&rsquo;t think it has fully sunk in, and even after my going away party this weekend, boarding that flight to LA on the 22nd, it still may even take sitting down at my desk before I finally realize what just happened.  So needless to say, I&rsquo;m thrilled with the opportunity Yahoo has presented, and during my time there I will do my best to ensure it is as rewarding for them as it is for me.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted to thank Fred &amp; Mary Kay Fosnacht for sharing their dream with me over the last 3 years.  Working for Catholic Content has been an amazing experience and certainly has been life-changing.  I can safely say that my career wouldn&rsquo;t have been the same without their confidence and encouragement and I will always be grateful for the opportunities they&rsquo;ve given me.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often times you&rsquo;ll come across the need to generate a random string.  When you search for something like &ldquo;PHP random string function&rdquo; which will probably just be cut &amp; pasted into your code, you&rsquo;ll typically find something like this function:</p>

<pre lang="php">
function genRandomString($length = 10) {
    $characters = ‘0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’;
    $string = ”;
    for ($p = 0; $p < $length; $p++) {
        $string .= $characters[mt_rand(0, strlen($characters))];
    }

    return $string;
}
</pre>


<p>While that&rsquo;s great and all, don&rsquo;t you just feel like there&rsquo;s some better, simpler way to generate a random string?  Preferably something done all in one line, so you don&rsquo;t even need a function inside your code?</p>

<p>There is a way.  Actually, there are lots of ways.  There are numerous functions in PHP that can be used to generate a string of random characters, and the one I typically use here is something you&rsquo;ve probably used quite a bit&hellip; md5().</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> is a commonly used hashing technique that can be used to generate a unique 32-character &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; of a string. While it has been shown to have some security holes and not be collision proof, that isn&rsquo;t really a concern the majority of the time you need to generate a random string.  So, we&rsquo;ll go ahead and use it here.</p>

<pre lang="php">
echo MD5(); // PHP Warning:  md5() expects at least 1 parameter, 0 given 
</pre>


<p>So, we need to pass in something, anything, but try to be unique.  microtime() is a good choice.</p>

<pre lang="php">
echo MD5(microtime()); // 5959e4c551ee3a91d89449437b681ead
</pre>


<p>Great, now we have a random 32 character string.  But what if you only want a slice of that, like 5 characters?  substr() is your answer.</p>

<pre lang="php">
echo substr(MD5(microtime(), 0, 5); // 5959e
</pre>


<p>If you are concerned about security and making this string even more random, just shuffle it with str_shuffle().</p>

<pre lang="php">
echo substr(str_shuffle(MD5(microtime())), 0, 5); // 6c468
</pre>


<p>Now wasn&rsquo;t that easy?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marshall Kirkpatrick of ReadWriteWeb had an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_web_in_five_years.php">interesting post</a> today recapping an interview with Google&rsquo;s CEO Eric Schmidt at last week&rsquo;s Gartner Symposium.  In a short, 6 minute segment out of the full 45 minute interview (video below), Schmidt hinted at what the future of the internet will bring.</p>

<p>Via RWW: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_web_in_five_years.php">Google&rsquo;s Eric Schmidt on What the Web Will Look Like in 5 Years</a></p>

<blockquote><ul><li>Five years from now the internet will be dominated by Chinese-language content.</li>
<li>Today&#8217;s teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years - they jump from app to app to app seamlessly.</li>
<li>Five years is a factor of ten in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a>, meaning that computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.</li> 
<li>Within five years there will be broadband well above 100MB in performance - and distribution distinctions between TV, radio and the web will go away.</li>
<li>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to make significant money off of Youtube&#8221;, content will move towards more video.</li>
<li>&#8220;Real time information is just as valuable as all the other information, we want it included in our search results.&#8221;</li>
<li>There are many companies beyond Twitter and Facebook doing real time.</li>
<li>&#8220;We can index real-time info now - but how do we rank it?&#8221;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s because of this fundamental shift towards user-generated information that people will listen more to other people than to traditional sources.  Learning how to rank that &#8220;is the great challenge of the age.&#8221; Schmidt believes Google can solve that problem.</li></ul></blockquote>


<div align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://swf.tubechop.com/tubechop.swf?vurl=lHxub_yQfig&start=1392&end=1762&cid=32815"></param><embed src="http://swf.tubechop.com/tubechop.swf?vurl=lHxub_yQfig&start=1392&end=1762&cid=32815" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>


<p>It&rsquo;s hard to argue with any of those, really.  The one I&rsquo;m looking forward to most of all is the convergence of media platforms as the lines between TV, Radio, and Web become more and more blurry.  As those lines become blurred, more innovation will occur between the gaps and the old-time revenue models based mostly on distribution begin to fall apart.</p>

<time datetime="2009-10-13T20:48:13-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 13<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are doing some more advanced JavaScript applications, you&rsquo;ll likely run into the problem at one point or another when you need to dynamically generate the name of a function you wish to call. This is the equivalent of PHP&rsquo;s <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php" target="_blank">call_user_func()</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can do it.</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
// Define some vars
var foo = "hello";
var bar = "world";
var function_name = "say_" + foo + bar;

// Since its name is being dynamically generated, always ensure your function actually exists
if (typeof(window[function_name]) === "function")
{
    window[function_name](" World!");
}
else
{
    throw("Error.  Function " + function_name + " does not exist.");
}

function say_helloworld(the_word)
{
    alert("Hello " + the_word);
}

// Browser will alert "Hello World!"
</pre>


<p>When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense considering all global objects in JavaScript are actually properties of the &ldquo;window&rdquo; object.  Take a look at this example to understand that concept a bit more.</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
var foo = "apple";

function foobar()
{
    var foo = "orange";
    alert(window["foo"]); // alerts "apple"
    alert(foo); // alerts "orange"
    alert(window["foobar"]); // alerts the foobar function
}

foobar();
</pre>


<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of when using a string to call a function could come in handy.  This time we&rsquo;re calling the property of an object we&rsquo;ve created.</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
function Person()
{
    this.message = "Hello World!";
    this.say_hello = function(to)
    {
        alert(this.message);
    }
}

var Derek = new Person();
function_name = "say_hello";
Derek[function_name]();
</pre>


<p>See how it looks pretty much the same as the method above using a global function?</p>

<p>Hope that shed some light on your problem.</p>

<p>But, the best feature in my eyes could be their JavaScript export option that can be dumped inside HTML5&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_%28HTML_element%29">&lt;canvas&gt;</a> tag to render &amp; animate the image. I haven&rsquo;t yet seen the source code this generates, but it seems logical that you could translate layer based vector art into JavaScript.</p>

<p>Another feature I also love is the integration with the various OSX FTP clients like CyberDuck and Transmit, as well as the dynamic web preview option.</p>

<p>With &lt;canvas&gt; being relatively new on the scene, a tool like this could really bridge the gap between designers &amp; developers and accelerate the adoption of another open standard that can help push the &ldquo;open web&rdquo; forward.</p>

<p>You can read more about Opacity at <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Turn_Your_Vector_Art_Into_Canvas-based_Animations_With_Opacity">WebMonkey&rsquo;s review</a> or check out Opacity&rsquo;s <a href="http://likethought.com/opacity/"> product page</a></p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t wait to get your hands on Chrome for OSX, go download a <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/LATEST/">Chromium nightly build</a>, unzip, and copy to your Applications folder.</p>

<p>At first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t appear much different from Safari, which isn&rsquo;t too surprising since they&rsquo;re both based off the the same layout engine (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a>).  The real differences are just going to come in the skin (which is pretty similar) and the JavaScript engine (Chromium = V8, Safari = Nitro, formerly &ldquo;Squirrelfish&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Rogers Cadenhead recently wrote a post &ldquo;<a href="http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3555/theres-reason-rsscloud-failed-catch/0">The Reason RSS Cloud Failed to Catch On</a>&rdquo;.  In this he argues that RSS Cloud is not sustainable when it begins to scale to thousands of users needing to receive pings every time a post is made.  While he has a point, I believe his argument is much more accurate when put into the context of 1999 as opposed to 2009, and it is even more irrelevant a few years from now.  This points to one thing&hellip; <strong>RSS Cloud was ahead of its time</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, supporting RSS Cloud is cheap.  Bandwidth is a fraction of a percent now compared to what is was 10 years ago along with cloud based virtual servers available for ~$10 / month.  I&rsquo;d suspect a properly tweaked VPS at the Rackspace Cloud or EC2 could handle millions of pings / day without issue.  Unlike PubSubHubBub, the content of the post is not delivered with RSS Cloud, it is just a body-less ping, so bandwidth isn&rsquo;t even an issue.  A server supporting these types of capabilities back in 1999 would have cost thousands of dollars per month.  Now?  Just a few bucks.  5 years from now I suspect it will be free (example: Google App Engine is currently free and could be configured for this service).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and take into consideration the dream scenario with RSS Cloud, and that is that we have completely replaced Twitter.  In this scenario Ashton Kutcher will have 5 million followers and will need to notify each of those followers when he tweets out 100 mundane posts / day.  Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves and <strong>not</strong> think there is a middle man in there somewhere.  These services are the &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; portion of whole term.  Just like Feedburner and Google Reader are proxies between publisher and reader now (by storing local caches of RSS feeds), there will be many services that would be happy to host the feeds, providing a web client to the reader and analytics to the publisher in turn receiving all the statistics they chew on.  Proof?  Twitter purchased Summize (search.twitter.com) and Google bought FeedBurner because they saw the value of this type of service.  Afterall, the analytics portion of that is the whole business model that Twitter is rumored to be building.</p>

<p>But ok&hellip; let&rsquo;s assume those &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; services never pop up because, hell&hellip; I don&rsquo;t see any reason why they wouldn&rsquo;t, but let&rsquo;s just imagine they don&rsquo;t exist.  Solution? TURN OFF THE NOTIFICATIONS!  That&rsquo;s the beauty of RSS Cloud feeds, it&rsquo;s completely backwards compatible with non-Cloud enabled feeds.  If the Cloud server fails to send out notifications, then their subscribers will simply revert back to the old method of routine polls looking for new content.  But, failing to notify your subscribers of new content in a sea of real-time has drastic consequences.  Even if you are the first to report information, you will always be &ldquo;scooped&rdquo; by others because the lag caused by your inability to notify your subscribers.  That alone will be enough to even the playing field.  As a compromise, you could get away with just notifying a few dozen RSS aggregators (Google, Yahoo, Feedburner) to take care of the majority of your subscribers, and those using readers you don&rsquo;t notify will revert to polls.</p>

<p>So as you can see, RSS Cloud is currently gaining traction because it wasn&rsquo;t until now that it was a viable service for the masses.  Even now there is very little support within the client portion of RSS Cloud, but I suspect that will be a battleground many will fight for in the next couple years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Wordpress.com <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/rss-in-the-clouds/">announced RSS Cloud support</a> for all their hosted blogs.  Not to be left out of the party, I also installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsscloud/">RSS Cloud plugin</a> on this blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://rsscloud.org/">RSS Cloud</a> is an ancient RSS element (in web 2.0 years) that has been given new life recently as the &ldquo;realtime web&rdquo; in exploding (thanks to Twitter and Facebook).  Basically, it allows RSS readers the ability to be notified when a feed has been updated instead of waiting minutes, hours, or days before that client has a chance to check the feed.  Now, an RSS Cloud supported reader that is subscribed to an RSS Cloud enabled feed can be notified within seconds that the feed has been updated.  RSS now has a realtime element.</p>

<p>RSS Cloud support is still in it&rsquo;s infancy with only 1 RSS reader supporting RSS Cloud notifications (<a href="http://newsriver.org/river2">River2</a>), but within the coming year, it could become a game-changing technology that can give rise to self hosted Twitter-like publishing platforms.  There&rsquo;s a number of people (myself included) that are working on such platforms, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to make an announcement in the coming weeks.  My feeling is, as great as Wordpress is for blogging, it&rsquo;s not the ideal platform for micro-blogging.  What the community needs is a microblog version of Wordpress that has a real-time element, and I think this RSS Cloud element fits the bill.</p>
