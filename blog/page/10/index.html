<p>Having just finished watching the controversial film, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363589/" title="">Elephant</a>&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll have to say that it was a very good, and also a rather haunting movie in which people will either love or hate.  Some say this movie was Gus Van Sant attempting to portray the Columbine shootings, however I believe it is fairly obvious when watching the movie that it is was more inspired by Columbine <u>as well as</u> all the other high school shootings in recent years.   Those were events that really engrained the reality and trauma some kids endure throughout high school, and the actions they can sometimes take.</p>

<p>I must say, there was little point or purpose to the film except to take you into an average day of a High School, but it was filmed and depicted in a very artistic and poetic manner.  Events and characters in this movie were not meant to be taken literally, but they were more representations which should be taken in a symbolic nature.  The characters represented the stereotypes which you find at every high school.  The scenes depicted the boredom, the insecurity, and the self-indulgence in high-schoolers lives.  High school ended quite a while ago for me, but it is still fresh in my mind that I could easily finds parts of characters to relate to.  It was also relieving to see high-schoolers actually play high schoolers, and high school not portrayed as a perfect little world of beautiful people as you commonly find in movies and TV now days.</p>

<p>This movie was needed becuase we don&rsquo;t need a re-creation or a hollywood-esque movie with a dramatic 30 minute standoff and suicides at the end telling us what exactly happened that day at Columbine, or how to feel about the events that have happened at numerous other high schools.  Van Sant rather exposes us to the banality of high school life, and the tragedy that can occur and let&rsquo;s us make up our own mind and feelings about what is happening.  I highly recommend this film, but be warned, it&rsquo;s not for everyone.  You&rsquo;ll either love it or hate it.  If you liked Almost Famous, you&rsquo;ll like this.  If you liked Armegeddon, you&rsquo;ll hate it.  If you liked Garden State, you&rsquo;ll love this.  If you thought Con Air, Coyote Ugly, or Dude Where&rsquo;s My Car were good movies, you&rsquo;ll hate this.</p>

<p>I just finished watching the documentary &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390336/">Overnight</a>&rdquo;, featuring Troy Duffy&rsquo;s overnight rise and fall in Hollywood.  If you don&rsquo;t recognize the name, he was writer and director of the cult hit &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/" title="">The Boondock Saints</a>&rdquo;.  Boondock really was an entertaining movie and from what I understand has had rather impressive DVD sales for being a low budget independent film.  The sequel has &ldquo;been in production&rdquo; for quite some time, but likely won&rsquo;t ever be made.</p>

<p>It was amazing to see how quickly &ldquo;the next big thing&rdquo; to hit Hollywood can crash back down to earth.  He had, what appeared to be sure-fire success as he landed a movie deal with Miramax and a record deal with Maverick at the same time.  He was convinced he was going to be the biggest thing ever in that town and stated multiple times that no one has ever done what he was about to do in the history of Hollywood.  But, he let his ego become the largest in Hollywood (which is quite an accomplishment), and pissed it all away.</p>

<p>How does one blow guaranteed success like that?  Easy, make enemies with the most powerful man in Hollywood (Harvey Weinstein, Miramax Chairman), call one of his executives the C word who ended up being a very powerful woman in Hollywood, piss off your band-mates, screw over your friends, get yourself blacklisted, and ultimately sign a crappy movie deal.  He told his crew (about 7 longtime friends) that if they played their cards right, they were looking towards at least &ldquo;20 years of success in the industry&rdquo; and it turns out they didn&rsquo;t even have one.  He thought there would be a bidding war at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival for his movie. &ldquo;In my opinion, this film will go big at the box office. Real Big.  It&rsquo;s one of the best independent films there ever was, and I am one of the best, and will be the best.&rdquo;  Turns out blacklisting yourself from the industry killed those chances.</p>

<p>My favorite part was when he was speaking to a film theory college course and managed to insult half the classroom by pointing out individuals who he felt weren&rsquo;t going to succeed and calling others assholes for paying him compliments (which he was too stupid to realize).</p>

<p>Definitely worth checking out.  It can really remind you how important staying humble is if given the chance at big time success.  It is also a very interesting look at the insides of Hollywood.</p>

<p>The movie ended with the perfect quote&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;No man is really changed by success.  What happens is that success works on the man&rsquo;s personality like a truth drug, bringing him out of the closet and revealing&hellip; what was always inside his head.&rdquo;</em> &ndash; Albert Goldman (Author)</p></blockquote>

<br style="clear:both"/>


<p>Over the past week, I had the pleasure of seeing two documentaries exposing two cultures in American society rarely seen up close, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342143/">Born Rich</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293088/">Devil&rsquo;s Playground</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Produced by 21 year old Jamie Johnson of the Johnson &amp; Johnson family, &ldquo;Born Rich&rdquo; was a look into the lives of himself and his peers, a handful of the heirs and heiresses of Americas wealth.  By watching, it&rsquo;s clear that Johnson doesn&rsquo;t have much experience making films, but that didn&rsquo;t detract from the film and the courage it took for a kid of his background to make a film solely about the wealth of his peers.  In their culture, Jamie&rsquo;s dad says that money is a taboo subject to be discussed publicly and reiterates over and over that he is not comfortable with his son making a film of this nature.  The family lawyer also recommends he not make this film as well.  But still&hellip; he rounds up a dozen or so of the nations wealthiest youth and grills them on a variety of questions ranging from their aspirations in life to their fears of being cut out of their inheritance.</p>

<p>Only a few come out showing some redeeming qualities (Ivanka Trump being one of them).  But there were a few others who fit the stereotype of rich, pompous, and whiny.  Not surprising Luke Weil tried (unsuccessfully) to sue Johnson to block the release of this film.  Maybe if he hadn&rsquo;t gloated about his money and said things like&hellip;  &ldquo;Fuck you. I&rsquo;m from New York&hellip; My family could buy your family. Piss off.&rdquo; or talking about only helping beggars just to get them away, he might not have worried about the film being released.   The security of being rich is of course attractive, but some of these kids showcase the fact that when you know nothing but money, you are completely oblivious to reality.</p>

<p>On the completely other-side of the cultural spectrum, &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo; is a look into the Amish lifestyle in America, specifically, the teenagers experience during &ldquo;Rumspringa.&rdquo;  In brief, the Amish believe that you shouldn&rsquo;t be born into religion or have it forced on you, rather you should decide to accept it yourself.  When an Amish teen turns 16, he/she is free to do whatever they choose, they are free from the confines of a strict Amish lifestyle.  Now picture yourself, 15 years old, living in rural Indiana, never having any of the things we take for granted in our busy (sub)urban lives, and boom&hellip; you turn 16, free to do whatever you want.  Free to experience all the temptations of drugs, alcohol, sex, etc&hellip;  You might not think it would be easy to find drugs in an Amish community, but this film follows Faron, an 18 year old drug dealer/meth addict struggling in his decision to commit to the church.  Basically, the night you turn 16, you have a party and drinks are pushed on you until you puke (not too different from the average 21 year old&rsquo;s birthday).  Because Amish children typically only attend school until 8th grade, at 16, you are living with you parents, with no real responsibilities (unless you work), so them being unleashed and thrown into the world is just like when a home-schooled kid goes off to college.  It&rsquo;s a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>The revelation that stuck me from watching these two films is that they really show happiness is only a state of mind and that money has nothing to do with it.  Both groups, one being poor, and the other being the rich, have roughly the same percentage in their groups who are miserable, lost, and confused.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/soccer/jsp.htm">these files</a> earlier today and have decided to throw them up here.  This is basically what you do with your time living in a college town during the summer, unemployed.  I don&rsquo;t even think at this point 6 years ago I had any idea what MySQL or PHP was, because if I did, it would have made everything a whole lot easier.  For my MLS simulator, I was using Java arrays containing about 10,000 items, and something tells me that isn&rsquo;t the most efficient way to move data.  Also this was back in the day when I used Word and Excel to make webpages, how embarrassing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Going on a 5th incarnation of my personal blog, I think I might actually stick with this one as opposed to the others that I&rsquo;ve tried.  I tried <a href="https://www.phpnuke.org/">PHP-Nuke</a>, but didn&rsquo;t have use for 99% of their capabilities.  Plus, I don&rsquo;t need a whole CMS for a simple blog.  As a PHP developer, I tried writing my own, but seemed like too much effort for something I didn&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;d end up using.  Then, I went against my programmer roots and went with <em>gasp</em>&hellip; a hosted blog.  But as I assumed, the lack of control killed it for me.  Since I have plenty of experience managing my own Windows and Linux servers, going with someone else to host my blog just wasn&rsquo;t going to fly.  So here we are, I just discovered <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and am fairly happy with it so far.  Installation was a breeze and the interface is great, so it&rsquo;s easy to understand why this is becoming one of the more popular blog platforms out there.</p>

<p>Anyways, enough about nothing, let&rsquo;s get into the fun stuff. What led me to Wordpress was <a href="http://www.gabrielserafini.com/archives/category/ajax/">this blog</a>, which I came across doing research on <a href="http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/">SAJAX</a> and <a href="http://jpspan.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php">JPSpan</a>.  Why SAJAX and JPSpan?  Ever since I first saw <a href="http://gmail.google.com">GMail</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>, the idea of using a single web page as an application intrigued me.  You can only make so many HTML forms and PHP scripts before you become a bit disgusted with the clunky nature of the Post->Process->Respond->Reload model that typically intertwines multiple languages, leaving complex and convoluted code for rather simple tasks.  Sure part of it might be my programming style, but the inherent nature of the whole system is also a big problem.  There must be a better way to do all this, right? More importantly, people are getting tired of the surfing the internet in the same way they did 10 years ago, the only thing that has drastically changed is the content.  But we are still stuck in the the following pattern&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>Client: Send the server a request;
Server: Respond to client with HTML page;
Server: Close connection;

Client: Re-establish connection with Server, send another request;
Server: Respond to client with HTML page;
Server: Close connection;
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat&hellip;</p>

<p>It is a dated process that needs to be replaced by something that behaves more like a true application.  Luckily we are starting to get glimpse of the web&rsquo;s future with some new concepts and approaches to developing web sites.  For example, check out <a href="http://www.faser.net/mab/chrome/content/mab.xul">XUL-Amazon</a>, an Amazon application written in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL">XUL</a>. <em>Yes, you need to use Firefox because IE doesn&rsquo;t have XUL support</em>.  Also, check out what <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ctholland/blog_assets/faser.net.amazon.xul.pdf">it looks like</a> on OSX, a real application!  In addition to XUL, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Microsoft has a few things up its sleeve in the upcoming &ldquo;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/productinfo/conceptvid/default.aspx">Longhorn</a>&rdquo; release of Windows to improve the web experience.</p>

<p>So now you might be asking an obvious question, &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Java and Flash in all this?&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t this whole client-server interaction on a universal platform what those are all about? Well, if they really were the solution, would we even be having this discussing right now?</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d encourage you to put on your thinking cap and ponder these new tools, technologies, and concepts.  There isn&rsquo;t one clear vision at this point, and each has their downside. XUL has potential, but IE probably won&rsquo;t ever support it. AJAX is a technology some developers have fallen in love with, but then others think it&rsquo;s just the latest Google fad and will disappear.  Application frameworks like JPSpan and SAJAX show promise, yet they approach developing web applications <em>very</em> differently.  Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188739.aspx">Avalon</a>&rdquo; (paired with .NET) should be able to solve this problem, but only for Windows PCs.</p>

<p>To conclude&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s safe to say it will be tough to predict exactly how things will play out and the tools we&rsquo;ll be using years from now, but I&rsquo;m sure it will be a fun ride.</p>
