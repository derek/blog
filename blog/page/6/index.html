  <div class="entry-content"><p>As innovative as I think that company is sometimes, holy crap can can they be ridiculous at other times!  It looks like <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_patents_search_strings.php">Amazon was just awarded a patent</a> for &ldquo;including a search string at the end of a URL without any special formatting.&rdquo;  Since when can you patent obvious stuff?  You shouldn&#8217;e be able to patent <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>!  Heck, just look at the search string in the URL <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness">wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness</a>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7287042">patent&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;Summary of Invention&rdquo; section</p>

<blockquote><p>For example, a user wishing to search for &ldquo;San Francisco Hotels&rdquo; may do by simply accessing the URL www.domain_name/San Francisco Hotels, where domain_name is a domain name associated with the web site system. The system may also support the use of Boolean operators and/or other types of operators within the search strings.</p></blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.  If the user is smart enough to know to type their search term in the URL, wouldn&rsquo;t that qualify as an obvious act?  And don&rsquo;t even get me started on prior art.  How funny is this, the Wikipedia entry for &ldquo;Prior art&rdquo; at the address of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art</a> goes back to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">July of 2004</a>, prior to the patent even being filed!</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art"><img src="http://www.derekgathright.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/amazon-wayback-prior-art2.jpg" alt="amazon-wayback-prior-art" /></a></p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s project for me will be to write a patent application for &lsquo;a method of using a permanent liquid stain (example: ink) on a contrasting color canvas to be used in permanently recording combinations of alphabetical and numeric characters.&#8217;  The publishing industry will be mine!!!</p>

<p>Can we please overhaul the patent system now?  Pretty please?</p>

<time datetime="2007-10-11T11:57:29-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a logical step, Google has launched a mobile version of it&rsquo;s ad network AdSense so users can now visit sponsored links on sites they are browsing on their phone.  The original incarnation of AdSense uses JavaScript to embed ads in a page, which carries little security risks to the user and the server the page is hosted on.  However, because most mobile devices don&rsquo;t support JavaScript, they had to resort to using servers-side scripting languages (PHP, Perl, ASP, etc..) to embed ads prior to delivering the page to the user.  Here&rsquo;s an example of the PHP version of Mobile AdSense.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$GLOBALS['google']['ad_type']='text';
$GLOBALS['google']['channel']='';
$GLOBALS['google']['client']='pub-5039159613133207';
$GLOBALS['google']['format']='mobile_single';
$GLOBALS['google']['https']=$_SERVER['HTTPS'];
$GLOBALS['google']['host']=$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$GLOBALS['google']['ip']=$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$GLOBALS['google']['markup']='xhtml';
$GLOBALS['google']['output']='xhtml';
$GLOBALS['google']['ref']=$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
$GLOBALS['google']['url']=$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$GLOBALS['google']['useragent']=$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];

require('http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.php');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While Google&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;Do No Evil&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t think they would ever do anything to harm a Mobile AdSense client&rsquo;s server, using server-side scripting languages presents a massive security hole on most servers.  Once I can execute that code on your serer, all bets are off.  One could access the database to gain customer information, redirect users to phishing sites, or even just reformat the hard drive just for the hell of it.  The best method for hacking a server running Mobile AdSense would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning" target="_blank">DNS Cache Poisoning</a>.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t exactly have any solutions on a method to deliver dynamic ads from the AdSense network that doesn&rsquo;t use JavaScript or a server-side scripting language, I find their approach completely unacceptable from a security perspective and you will find a lot of objection in the enterprise community towards this method.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/2005/09/11/googleair/">this GoogleAir post</a> way back when, I&rsquo;ve always gotten a ton of hits for the search query &ldquo;Google Air&rdquo;.  When those started flooding in, I wondered who actually owned googleair.com, and from what I recall, it was some random company that I don&rsquo;t remember anything about.  Well, fast forward to the present day and I was curious to see if Google had taken ownership of googleair.com, and it looks like they have.  It doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere right now, and Google owns tons of domains that they probably never use (for copyright reasons), but I did find it interesting considering Google is looking to buy a big slice of the airwaves when the FCC auctions them off in a few months, and we&rsquo;ve been hearing tons of rumors of a GooglePhone.</p>

<p>Who remembers two years ago when Yahoo was rumored to be buying Facebook for $1 billion and people thought Y! was crazy.  Then, Facebook said &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re holding out for $2.5 billion?&rdquo;, and people thought FB was absolutely nuts?  Well, fast-forward the clock, Facebook is now open, not only to non-college students, but also &ldquo;open&rdquo; as in an open development platform that anyone can develop applications for.  Now, Microsoft is considering buying them&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119065193646437586.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">Microsoft Is in Talks To Buy Facebook Stake &ndash; WSJ.com</a></p>

<p>One estimate puts FB at a $10 Billion (Yes, with a B).  At first, that seems like an insanely high number, but then factor into the equation FB&rsquo;s goal to create a social map of the world and their business savvy leaders, and well&hellip; ok, $10 Billion still seems insanely high.  But hey, if M$ wants to spend that much money, they can, and people will call them crazy, like they will.  Read on and you&rsquo;ll find this gem, &ldquo;Facebook has indicated that it might hold out for a higher valuation – as much as $15 billion&rdquo; WTF?!?!  $300 Million (profit) / $15 Billion = 50 P/E ratio.  And FYI, Google&rsquo;s P/E ratio is currently at 48.</p>

<p>So there you go Google, Facebook considers itself more valuable than you, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/social/?p=314">go get &lsquo;em</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img width="250" height="235" src="http://www.mp3newswire.net/Graphics/6002/Zune.jpg" />
This is a response to the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20060929/zune-ipod-microsoft-apple-price.htm">International Business Times&#8217; report</a> that the new soon-to-be-launched Microsoft Zune is going to hurt &ldquo;Microsoft and partners more than Apple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their take&hellip; there are two camps right now, one is Apple, and the other is Microsoft&rsquo;s partners who sell music using MS&rsquo;s WMA audio/DRM codec. Their belief is that the one who will hurt the most with the Zune is the partners, who are going to be squeezed out and it will just turn into a Microsoft vs. Apple battle.</p>

<p>My take&hellip; Yes, that is pretty much true, but do I see anything wrong with it? No, because would Microsoft be doing this had their partners actually competed with Apple? No. Right now Apple and it&rsquo;s iPod hold a <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage_c.php?leftnm=11&bKeyFlag=IN&autono=6327">72% market share</a> of MP3 players while all of Microsoft&rsquo;s partners combined carry the remaining 28%. To me, this is just Microsoft telling the little guys, &ldquo;You had your chance, you failed, and now it is our turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a reason Apple hasn&rsquo;t put any innovative features into the iPod (I&rsquo;m talking far beyond giving it a color screen and allowing it to play movies), because they haven&rsquo;t needed to as none of the challengers had come up with anything innovative themselves. In it&rsquo;s debut release, the Zune will alone have wireless capabilities, an FM tuner, &amp; file sharing capabilities, things I don&rsquo;t see the Apple introducing into the iPod anytime soon.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t read this thinking I&rsquo;m anti-Apple/iPod and pro-Microsoft, I&rsquo;m just desperate for more competition to create more innovative products. When I was shopping for an MP3 player two years ago, I was really unimpressed with the offerings out there and eventually just settled a small Dell Axim PDA, not much bigger than an iPod, and that has given me far greater options and capabilities than a traditional MP3 player.  Still, it&rsquo;s limitations are enough to make me crave a true MP3 player, but I have nothing to settle that craving until someone offers something worth spending $250-$300 on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes! I found the evidence I&rsquo;ve been looking for all these years.  Now I am finally going to prove that Scott Stapp&rsquo;s band &ldquo;Creed&rdquo; was simply living off the fame my band in junior high garnered around the greater Olathe, KS area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it’s been a few months since my last post, but that’s for a good reason.  Let’s take a look back at the last few months for me…</p>

<p><strong>April</strong>
&ndash; Enter 96.5 The Buzz’s 2nd Chance Prom Prom King contest
&ndash; Go to Vegas for a bachelor Party
&ndash; Return from Vegas, win prom king, and have an awesome time at prom</p>

<p><strong>May</strong>
&ndash; Spend a week in Cancun
&ndash; See Depeche Mode, one of my favorite bands ever
&ndash; Spend 10 days in Europe (Barcelona, Paris, &amp; London)</p>

<p><strong>June</strong>
&ndash; Finally return to work, only to be recruited by an advertising agency a few blocks away from where I live (Downtown Kansas City) and am offered a great opportunity that I’d be crazy to pass on.  I took the job.</p>

<p><em><strong>Coming up</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>June</strong>
&ndash; Float trip with a bunch of friends this coming weekend</p>

<p><strong>July</strong>
&ndash; Start my new job
&ndash; Go to one of my old roommates weddings in Omaha</p>

<p><strong>August &ndash; October</strong>
&ndash; Come up with something creative to do</p>

<p><strong>November</strong>
&ndash; Go see the Jayhawks play likely #1 Florida in Vegas</p>

<p><strong>December</strong>
&ndash; Birthday &amp; Christmas</p>

<p>Soooo&hellip;.. I haven&rsquo;t really been bored enough to write about anything lately as the last few months have probably been the craziest, most exciting months of my life.  A lot of times people say you come back from vacations re-energized and motivated.  No, really, I started the month of May pretty motivated with work, and at the end of the month, had nothing left.  Now all I want to do is travel, hah.  I was really getting used to the whole work 10 days a month &amp; travel to other countries the rest of the time thing.  Oh well.</p>

<p>But here is the point of this post&hellip; The one thing I have learned from the last few months is that while you need luck for things to go your way sometimes, luck isn&rsquo;t completely out of your control.  If you continually put yourself in new situations, try new things, and make good decisions about the things you can control, the things out of your control will start to fall your way.</p>

<p>There has been one specific quote that has really stayed with me through this process&hellip; &ldquo;Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative&rdquo; &ndash; Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>Nothing could be more true, so go experience something new.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With Google&rsquo;s stock <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/CNBCTV/Articles/Dispatches/P136522.asp">now topping $400</a>, a community centric with no current business model website like Digg.com <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/financial_markets/venture_capital/13019053.htm">getting a few million in venture capital</a>, IM client piggy-backing services like Meebo getting <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/13164800.htm">&ldquo;smothered with requests to make an investment&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://today.reuters.com/business/newsArticle.aspx?storyID=nN06182182">Bloggers making millions</a>, and in general&hellip; the whole &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; revolution going on right now has led many to question where the web is heading.  Did we learn from our lessons last time when the bubble burst, or is the Web 2.0 revolution going to see the same fate in 5 years?  John Battelle <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/18/opinion/18battelle.html?ex=1289970000&amp;amp;en=24406e5d4b2c0bed&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss">ponders that very question</a> in a recent op-ed article for the NY Times.  His opinion?  No bubble to be found.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most companies this time around are taking the path of acquisition, finding homes at large, stable and profitable companies like Yahoo, Google, News Corporation or Barry Diller&rsquo;s InterActiveCorp. The era of the hot Net I.P.O. is over, and good riddance.  &hellip; So sure, there are too many start-ups, and sure, some venture capitalists are trying to get in on as many as they can. In the meantime, far more companies are starting that just might change the world, or at least interesting parts of it, and thanks to the lessons of the past, we now have an ecosystem that may enable them to make a serious go of it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>That second half of the quote goes nicely with my <a href="/blog/posts/nerdtv/">Nerd TV post</a> a few months back, about geeks wanting to program because they want to &ldquo;change the world.&rdquo;  In this new age of the internet, that can easily be done with a good idea.  This current web revolution is customer &amp; community centric, not business model centric.  We are seeing sites like Digg.com just have a good idea, give people the stories they want, and give them the power to determine what is newsworthy, not editors.</p>

<p>With such a community centric idea comes accelerated growth because the best publicity is word of mouth, and with accelerated growth comes a business model as it is needed to support and expand the service.  I&rsquo;m sure Digg is losing money hand over fist right now as Google Ads cannot support servers and bandwidth at the rate Digg is consuming both.  Kevin Rose (co-founder) has stated that since their VC money came, a business model is being developed and we will see it soon.  I think all of us in the industry are following this one closely.  If they can turn such a successful, simple idea with no business model into one that does, and implement it without breaking what makes Digg so popular, that is good news for all of us and it is time to break out of the mold with some new ideas.</p>
