  <div class="entry-content"><p>As JavaScript becomes a more integral part to the core functionality of websites, ensuring that a user has a fresh copy of the latest code is as important as ever.  Normally a browser will cache certain filetypes (CSS, JS, JPG, etc&hellip;) for an indefinite period of time.  If the code within one of these cached files is updated, sometimes a browser will not know to reload that file.  So, if those changes are important for the functionality of your website, your users may run into issues and not be able to use your site properly.  Worse, they likely won&rsquo;t have any idea what the issue is and will eventually give up and go elsewhere. But have no fear, there&rsquo;s a solution to this problem&hellip; versioning your static files.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;versioning&rdquo; these files, I&rsquo;m referring to changing their filenames from &ldquo;my_styles.css&rdquo; to &ldquo;my_styles.version274.css&rdquo; for example.  The problem with that example is it relies on you renaming the file and updating your includes <strong>every time</strong> you make a change.  That sounds like an nightmare, right?  Luckily there&rsquo;s a neat tactic you can you to make it appear to the browser to be a new file, but it will actually be the same file and will require no effort on your part.  This variation of the versioning tactic is often referred to as &ldquo;Auto-versioning&rdquo;.  Here&rsquo;s an example&hellip;</p>

<p>First, we use the following rewrite rule in .htaccess:</p>

<pre lang="ini">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-s # Make the file doesn't actually exist
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.[\d]+\.(css|js)$ $1.$2 [L] # Strip out the version number
</pre>


<p>Now, we write the following PHP fuction:</p>

<pre lang="php">
/**
 *  Given a file, i.e. /css/base.css, replaces it with a string containing the
 *  file's mtime, i.e. /css/base.1221534296.css.
 *  
 *  @param $file  The file to be loaded.  Must be an absolute path (i.e.
 *                starting with slash).
 */
function auto_version($file)
{
  if(strpos($file, '/') !== 0 || !file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $file))
    return $file;

  $mtime = filemtime($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $file);
  return preg_replace('{\\.([^./]+)$}', ".$mtime.\$1", $file);
}
</pre>


<p>Now, wherever you include your CSS, change it from this:</p>

<pre lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blog/css/base.css" type="text/css" />
</pre>


<p>To this:</p>

<pre lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?=auto_version('/css/base.css')?>" type="text/css" />
</pre>


<p>And when rendered, will appear as:</p>

<pre lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blog/css/base.1251992914.css" type="text/css" />
</pre>




<p>How does this work?  Because that mod_rewrite rule above will strip out the timestamp, your server will deliver /css/base.css as the requested file.  But to the user&#8217;s browser, it will appear as a different file whenever it is updated.</p>




<p>Neat!</p>




<br />


<hr />


<br />




<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some strategies to fix this caching issue is to append a version # onto the end of the css or JavaScript file with a querystring, such as:</p>


<pre lang="html">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blog/css/base.css?version=1234" type="text/css" />
</pre>




<p>This method will actually prevent the file from being cached, period!  This is bad.  You want the benefits of caching.  You don&#8217;t want to make your users pull down 100k of JavaScript & CSS files on every page load.  More importantly, your servers could start to strain under the additional load.</p>




<p>Why is it not cached?  See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">Section 13 from the HTTP Specification</a>, in particular Section 13.9</p>




<blockquote>
<strong>13.9 Side Effects of GET and HEAD</strong>

Unless the origin server explicitly prohibits the caching of their responses, the application of GET and HEAD methods to any resources SHOULD NOT have side effects that would lead to erroneous behavior if these responses are taken from a cache. They MAY still have side effects, but a cache is not required to consider such side effects in its caching decisions. Caches are always expected to observe an origin server&#8217;s explicit restrictions on caching.

We note one exception to this rule: since some applications have traditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a &#8220;?&#8221; in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side effects, caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless the server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically means that responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT be taken from a cache. See section 9.1.1 for related information.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came across one of the coolest music videos I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and the beauty of it? It was made by a fan, just for the fun of it.  Incredible.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://vimeo.com/5904993">Two Weeks - Grizzly Bear</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1904617">Gabe Askew</a>.</p>




<div align="center"><object width="400" height="220"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5904993&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5904993&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="220"></embed></object></div>




<p>One of the first things I thought about while watching Gabe&#8217;s video was whether this would be yet another take-down viral video because of copyright infringement?  But, a group like Grizzly Bear (or their record label) would be crazy to complain about the soundtrack because of the attention it generates for the song.</p>




<p><p>You could either be a band that removes the soundtrack from someone&rsquo;s artistic work, infuriating them and accomplishing nothing.  Or, you could capitalize off it, much like Chris Brown&rsquo;s (or his record label&rsquo;s) decision to <strong>not</strong> remove the soundtrack from the &ldquo;JK Wedding Dance&rdquo; video that ended up boosting him to #4 on the iTunes charts and <a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b137057_could_viral_wedding_dance_video_save.html">possibly saved his career</a>.</p>

<p><div align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4-94JhLEiN0&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4-94JhLEiN0&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div></p>

<p>Another recent example is the use of Barcelona&rsquo;s &ldquo;Please Don&rsquo;t Go&rdquo; song in a tranquil aquarium video that has been 1.8 million views at the times of this posting.  The band was so pleased that they posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqlpa3EWsok&feature=response_watch">video response</a> to introduce themselves to their new fans and credited the video towards increased albums sales and concert attendance.  Instead of saving a career (as in Brown&rsquo;s case), this very well could make a career for these guys, and all because they lucked out and had a passionate, artistic fan that wanted to showcase both their works, together.</p>

<p><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u7deClndzQw&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u7deClndzQw&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></p>

<p>Gabe&rsquo;s video is yet another great example of how music artists (and any celebrities) for that matter can use their fans to crowdsource ideas and content.  Instead of spending thousands or millions to produce a video, you can get really high quality content for next to nothing, all because your fans are passionate about your work and want to be more involved.  So get them involved, they want to be, and they&rsquo;ll reward you for the opportunity.</p>

<p>As a final example, here&rsquo;s a video from Tilly &amp; The Wall which was completely crowdsourced by their fans.  All they did was ask users to send in clips of them singing their song &ldquo;Rainbows in the Dark&rdquo; and spliced them all together, making an awesome, fun, and cheap video.  Imagine a progressive band like Nine Inch Nails or Radiohead saying they weren&rsquo;t going going to make a video for their latest single and instead were holding a contest for a fan to make an &ldquo;official video&rdquo; for that song and awarding $20k?  Contests like that can become a breeding crowd for viral videos, something all musicians are dying for nowdays.</p>

<p><div align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8LUCC4HSb-c&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8LUCC4HSb-c&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"  width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m involved with organizing two upcoming events in the Kansas City area for web developer/designers.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PreDevCamp &ndash; Kansas City</span></p>

<p>This is an event we just announced today that will be a &ldquo;bootcamp&rdquo; for developing on Palm&rsquo;s new Mojo SDK platform, which is the development toolkit for the upcoming Palm Pre phone.</p>

<p>Website: <a href="http://kansascity.predevcamp.org/">PreDevCamp &ndash; Kansas City</a>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">StartupWeekend &ndash; Kansas City</span></p>

<p>StartupWeekends are events that have been occuring nationwide for the past couple years, and it is Kansas City&rsquo;s first  chance to host one.  These events typically take place over a weekend, starting Friday afternoon, and ending Sunday evening.  During this event, teams of developers, designers, project managers, marketing peeps, etc&hellip; will break off into teams and at the weekend the goal is to have a company up &amp; running with a prototype product built to demo to potential investors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s another &ldquo;How-to&rdquo; with 1and1 hosting, and this time I want to get the source code control/versioning program &ldquo;Git&rdquo; installed on my shared host with 1&amp;1.  This was actually remarkably easy.</p>

<ol>
    <li> Go download Git from http://git-scm.com/download.  At the time of this posting, the latest version can be found at http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.6.1.tar.gz</li>
    <li>SSH into your 1&amp;1 account</li>
    <li>&#8220;wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.6.1.tar.gz&#8221;, and that will download the package</li>
    <li>&#8220;tar -xvzf git-1.6.1.tar.gz&#8221; which will decompress the gzip file into a subdirectory</li>
    <li>&#8220;cd git*&#8221; to change into the subdirctory</li>
    <li>&#8220;make&#8221; to begin compiling the source.  You won&#8217;t be able to do &#8220;make install&#8221; because you likely won&#8217;t have permission to install anything to the system.</li>
    <li>Now Git is ready to rock with the exception of needing to add it to your $PATH.  This can be done by typing &#8220;echo &#8216;PATH=$PATH:~/git-1.6.1/&#8217; &gt; ~/.profile&#8221;</li>
</ol>


<p>Done!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogging is something that comes in waves for me, and once I get out of the habit, it is tough to get back into it.  I enjoy it, but sometimes there’s just so much going on that it completely escapes me.  The last few months have been one of those periods.  So let’s start from the top…</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a new project recently.  <a href="http://www.tweenky.com">Tweenky</a> is a micro blogging client I am developing that is mostly used with Twitter, but also supports Identi.ca, and hopefully more micro-blogging services soon.  The concept behind it was the lack of any good web clients out there for Twitter, and especially ones that brought back the “track” feature that Twitter took away from us a few weeks back.  It’s still very much a work in progress and I just have to find the time to work on some of the new features and further improve stability.  I’m having a blast with pushing the boundaries of JavaScript and what it should/shouldn’t be used for.  So, if you are a Twitter user, go check it out, and if it is still requiring an invite code, use “derekville”.</p>

<p>So I just returned from a convention out in Santa Clara called Zendcon.  As a web developer, my primary language of choice is PHP, and Zend is the company puts most of the work into the PHP project, so this was kind of their little yearly shindig.  It was 4 days of 1-2 hour training sessions on all topics related to PHP and web development.  I saw some presentations from engineers and developers from companies such as IBM, Google, Mozilla, Digg, Yahoo, and tons more.  I met a ton of really interesting people too and had a great time at Yahoo HQ for Hackday &lsquo;08.  (note to self: Don&rsquo;t wear &ldquo;Hackday &#8216;08&rdquo; shirt to airport, it leads to hacker questioning from TSA agents)</p>

<p>Vacation #1 was on the front &amp; back end of the Zendcon trip as I had a few days before &amp; after the conference to play around in San Francisco.  It’s such a cool city and I had a blast driving around in the Pontiac G6 convertible I rented for the week.  I’ve never had so much fun driving a car!</p>

<p>Vacation #2 is coming up next month with Katye &amp; I flying up to Seattle where we’ll also head up to Vancouver &amp; Victoria.  I haven’t been to Seattle in about 10 years, so I’m really excited as I love that city.  Everyone I’ve talked to raves about Vancouver too, so I’m pretty excited about my first trip north of the border.</p>

<p>If you are a web developer in the Kansas City area, you need to check out two emerging groups.  The first being <a href="http://webstandards.meetup.com/121/">DotNext</a>, a group in the KC area that gets together every month or so to give sessions on anything web development related.  Last month was a series of presentations of Amazon Web Services.  This month is going to be on various database related technologies. The second group is <a href="http://cowtowncomputercongress.org/index.php/Main_Page">Cowtown Computer Congress</a> who is setting up a hacker space in North Kansas City.  For those not too familiar with what a “hacker space” is (myself included), it is a place for technologists to get together to work on  various hardware &amp; software projects, share costs on equipment, and actually socialize (something most geeks never do much of).  So should be an awesome place to convene when it officially opens in the next couple months.</p>

<p>And finally, a new podcast from some rather influential people in the web development world has launched that I’d like to mention.  <a href="http://openwebpodcast.com/">Open Web Podcast</a> was created by Google engineer <a href="http://almaer.com/blog/">Dion Almaer</a> (of the Ajaxian podcast as well), <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/">Alex Russell</a> of Dojo, and <a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig</a> of Mozilla/jQuery.  So if you are into web standards and JavaScript, definitely check it out.</p>

<p>Finally, I recently discovered the FX show &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&rdquo;.  Hilarious!  Check out all the episodes on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia">Hulu</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A user uploaded a Quicktime video to my website the other day and the server ran into a problem transcoding it to FLV.  I hit up #ffmpeg and it was suggested that I upgrade my install of FFMPEG and libfaad.  Alrighty, no big deal, done it before.  So first thing this morning was going to be update the sources and recompile.</p>


<p>Before I get on with that, first I&#8217;ll describe the environment.  We&#8217;re running on RHEL4 and have an install of FFMPEG that works fine (aside from that 1 user uploaded video).  The last upgrade of FFMPEG to get h264 support wasn&#8217;t done by me, but rather our sysadmin, when we actually had a sysadmin. I believe he used rpms for the libraries and compiled FFMPEG from the SVN repo.</p>


<p>So I did a quick search just to remind myself what libraries I needed and I came across <a href="http://pixels-and-politics.blogspot.com/2008/03/compile-ffmpeg-on-rhel4.html">this post</a> about compiling on RHEL4, our distro. Perfect.  I followed directions to a T (aside from upgrading SVN) and it compiled fine.  Now, time to run a test transcode&#8230;</p>

<p>Well shit.  Ok, so I hit up #ffmpeg again, but don&#8217;t get any help, so I try recompiling without any config options and it works fine.  So I slowly start added on config options and it works until I add &#8220;&#8211;enable-share&#8221;, and which point it compiles a version of FFMPEG that throws the &#8220;undefined symbol&#8221; error.  So that gives me a pretty good idea it has something to do with that.  I go through the symlinks in the guide (linked above) and notice that /usr/lib/libavformat.so.50 is symlinked to a file that doesn&#8217;t exist.  And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at now, kinda stumped.  Am I missing libraries?  how can I ensure any old libraries installed before are cleaned out and not conflicting with new ones?  I&#8217;m a developer, not a linux admin.  I know my way around the OS, but when it comes to this type of stuff, I&#8217;m stumped.</p>


<p>Any ideas? post a comment or email/gtalk me at drgath at gmail.com.</p>

C&#8217;mon guys, you clearly don&rsquo;t understand what is being requested, so ask for clarification instead of being so stubborn.  We understand you are busy getting this project off the ground, but you need to understand that you can&rsquo;t fight with your own developers, especially this early in the game.  If you can&rsquo;t manage that, they why did you open source it in the first place?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Sorry for the Sprint emphasis early on, they are a local company that is always a center of  attention around here.</em></p>

<p>Sprint, as a brand, is pretty much dead. I can&rsquo;t believe how badly Gary Forsee crippled that company. They purchased Nextel for $35 billion just three years ago, destroyed its network and fractured its customer base, and are now trying to sell it for a measly $5 billion while the FCC says it must relocate to a different spectrum, likely costing billions. Meanwhile, their landline services have since been spun-off as Embarq, and this <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/06/clearwire-wimax-32-billion/">latest move</a> to offload its future 4G operation to Clearwire is an indication that the end is near.</p>

<p>So now they&rsquo;ll turn around and sell Nextel, crippling that poor brand even more and leaving it as a shell of what it once was. At that point, all &ldquo;Sprint&rdquo; will have left is a backbone ISP operation, a dying wireless brand that will likely <a href="http://blog.derekville.net/2008/05/05/sprint-dumping-nextel/">be sold to T-Mobile</a>, investments in all of the spin-offs, and an arena that still doesn&rsquo;t have an NBA team. (Humor for the KC readers)</p>

<p>Goodbye &ldquo;Sprint&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;ll be in 5 years. 100+ year old companies don&rsquo;t just dissapear into thin air, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be very recognizable. Again, I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Sprint&rdquo; the brand.  Sprint the stock ticker is a great investment right now as I&rsquo;ve been preaching the last couple months.  If you do still have your wireless voice services, I&rsquo;m sure it will be under a commodity / white label brand until the current technology dies and eventually you&rsquo;ll sell your shares in all your spin-offs to pay off the debt you racked up.</p>

<p>But, having said that, I think the move makes perfect sense and is a well played strategy. Sprint &amp; Clearwire&rsquo;s WiMAX project has great potential, but they have no money to fund it since Clearwire is only 4 years old and Sprint is $20 billion in debt, so they absolutely needed to join forces. Along with the new merger, they will also get an influx of much needed cash from Comcast, Intel, Time Warner, &amp; Google, who are throwing in a $3.2 Billion investment.</p>

<p>So, the landscape is now set for The Great Wireless Broadband War of 2008-2014 (can I trademark that?)</p>

<p><strong>Side A</strong>
A) Sprint &ndash; Owns a large chunk of the back-end of the internet
B) Google &ndash; Owns a large chunk of the front-end of the internet
C) Comcast &amp; Time Warner &ndash; Owns cable television &amp; residential internet in the US
D) Intel &ndash; Owns the processors that will power everything
E) Skype &ndash; <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/4/ebay_selling_skype_to_google_let_us_pray">Assuming Google buys it</a></p>

<p><strong>Side B</strong>
A) AT&amp;T vs Verizon &ndash; Dominant telcos in US who are launching their own 4G network sometime <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/04/verizon-announces-700mhz-lte-plans-can-you-wait-3-years/">next</a> <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/04/03/atandt-says-b-block-and-aloha-spectrum-will-go-to-lte/">decade</a>.
B) British Telecom &ndash; Dominant telco in UK
C) NTT &ndash; Dominant telco in Japan
D) Deutsch Telecom &ndash; Dominant telco in Germany
E) <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/06/global-telcos-plotting-a-skype-rival/">Unnamed Skype Killer</a> they are rumored to be working on to run on their closed networks.</p>

<p>So who will win? That&rsquo;s a tough one, but here are some suggested investments; CLWR, S, GOOG, &amp; INTC. Openness wins in the digital world.</p>

<p>Link to article on The Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121001458454368317.html">Sprint Mulls Separating Nextel Unit</a></p>

<p>Considering how many customers they&rsquo;ve lost due to outages since the merger, it&rsquo;s clear that move was the worst idea in Sprint&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>So, their stock is up ~75% from where it was since I told you to buy it a few weeks back. Hopefully you listened to me. If not, it&rsquo;s still not too late, Deutsche Telekom is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2008/gb2008055_779933.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories">looking to buy them</a> which would give it quite a boost.</p>

<p>Best scenario would be for Sprint to dump Nextel somehow, in turn making themselves more attractive for a Deutsche Telekom/T-Mobile purchase, then merge the two and become the #1 US cell carrier. Whose network the customers go to doesn&rsquo;t matter, T-Mobile&rsquo;s more compatible GSM would be preferable though. Sure, you won&rsquo;t have any offerings to compete with AT&amp;T and Verizon&rsquo;s wired internet and cable TV offerings (FiOS &amp; uVerse), but who cares, you&rsquo;ll have a great headstart over them in the wireless broadband market, which is obviously where the future is. Finally, embed Sprint Xohm chips in everything from laptops to VoIP phones to toasters, and print money uncontested. But most importantly, differentiate the labels, market the voice service as T-Mobile and the data as Sprint/Xohm because both are used for very different purposes.</p>

<p>Glass half empty says Sprint is fucked. Glass half full says the worst is over, your current model sucks, so time to move on to something new &amp; innovative.</p>
