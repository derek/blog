  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051111/ap_on_hi_te/sony_copy_protection">Yahoo has an article</a> about how three trojan horse viruses have been found that exploit the massive serurity hole left by Sony&rsquo;s rootkit.  It also reports a class action lawsuit has already been filed, and the EFF is looking into filing another.  As I blogged earlier, it is in their EULA that they can install whatever they want, but EULAs have been shot down in court before, so let&rsquo;s hope this one is as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1884677,00.asp">Paul Roberts reports on EWeek</a> that Microsoft  is considering &lsquo;taking action&rsquo; against Sony with regards to its <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1880543,00.asp">rootkit</a> that has been all over the news recently.  This comes on top of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000890063698/">Microsoft claiming</a> Sony&rsquo;s next-gen DVD format (Blu-Ray) is &ldquo;Anti-Consumer.&rdquo;  Anti-consumer?  Pot, meet kettle.  How many anti-trust lawsuits has Microsoft had slapped against them in the last few decades?  Still, I&rsquo;m totally with them.  The Blu-Ray DRM is waaaaaay over the top.
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000737057152/">&ldquo;Bricking&rdquo; your Blu-Ray player for tinkering with it?</a>
<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1846104,00.asp">Dynamically updated copy protection schemes</a>
<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000420067137/">Discs locked in to one specific Blu-Ray player making it even &ldquo;borrow-proof&rdquo; between friends?</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to sit here and defend anyone&rsquo;s right to copy intellectual property, but I&rsquo;m not going to defend a companies right to have a monopoly over <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">innovation</a>, <a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000113.html">break my analog equipment</a> (<a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">here </a>also), and make the process of being entertained by watching a movie a nightmare of making sure my Blu-Ray player is hooked up to the internet before I am able to watch a movie so it can download the latest copy protection schemes, and renting a copy of a movie I already own just so I can watch it at a friends house.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just the geek in me, but watching Microsoft v. Sony throwdown would be entertaining as hell.  People seem to think Microsoft is a mindless power &amp; money hungry corporation, but Sony is 10 times worse.  When was the last time you heard about Microsoft suing people for pirating their $200-$300 software?  Ok, now when was the last time you heard about Sony &amp; the RIAA suing people for pirating $.99 songs?  Oh wait, $.99 is <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/09/30/2037203.shtml?tid=98&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=3">too little now for the RIAA </a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/8397/evilsesamestreetc2yz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-6033_1-6376177.html?tag=nl.e501">In a scathing attack on Sony</a>, CNet editor Molly Wood calls this last week as the beginning of a war the media content companies have waged on its own consumers.  How did that happen?  In one of the dumbest ideas I&rsquo;ve ever seen by a technology company, Sony somehow though it was acceptable to force the user to install a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkit</a> in order to listen to some albums under their record label.  Have a listen to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4989260">this NPR report</a> for more breifing on this situation.  By the way, someone needs to tell <a href="http://www.cdt.org/staff/ari.php">Ari Schwartz</a>, Associate Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, who was interviewed by NPR that the &ldquo;root&rdquo; part of the term is not derived because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s at the root of the computer&rdquo; but rather because by having &ldquo;root&rdquo; access on a unix/linux based system means you have super-admin access.  It&rsquo;s really not that big of a deal, except for his occupation as a Washington DC technology lobbyist.  I would have hoped he knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>How about this comment from the story as well&hellip; the President of Sony BMG&rsquo;s Global Digital Business stated &ldquo;Most people, I think, do not even know what a Rootkit is, so why should they care about it?&rdquo;  How unbelievable is that?!?! Ignorance is bliss I guess Mr. Hessa.  I just couldn&rsquo;t believe a Sony exec would say such a thing, basically saying that what you don&rsquo;t know doesn&rsquo;t concern you, even though it is on your personal computer.</p>

<p>Anyways&hellip;  Sony&rsquo;s latest attempt is just a a natural evolution of the media/software/technology companies attempts at preventing people from doing perfectly legal things with products they buy (CD &ldquo;Ripping&rdquo; falls under fair use laws).  Molly Wood gives a great description of what we are facing now days and how absurd it is getting.</p>

<blockquote>
<b class="a3">No, we ain&#8217;t gonna take it</b><br />
This is an unacceptable development in digital rights enforcement. I don&#8217;t know how to put this any more clearly. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#45;&#45;we&#8217;ve long since crossed the line. It&#8217;s utterly absurd that we accept paying for music that <a href="/blog/4520-6490_1-5140299-1.html?tag=txt">will play on only one or two digital audio players</a>, at best. It&#8217;s absolutely insane that anyone ever tried to put out a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-270164.html">CD that couldn&#8217;t be ripped to a PC</a> at all. It&#8217;s a complete joke that we&#8217;re sitting around anticipating the day when TiVo comes along to tell us <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/09/tivo_72_os_adds.html">when we have to watch a recorded show</a>, and that it will choose when a recorded show might be deleted. I can&#8217;t even believe cell phone carriers think it&#8217;s OK to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=crippled+bluetooth&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">cripple cell phone features</a> in order to protect their own moneymaking propositions. And Hollywood&#8217;s proposed new <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/01/hollywood_after_the_.html">Analog Hole</a> legislation, which would criminalize nearly every digital video activity you can think of, is another column unto itself, and it&#8217;s going to be a <i>long</i> one.<br /><br />

But this&#45;&#45;using the tactics of criminals to invade our PCs without our knowledge and to expose us to further attack, just so you can keep us from, say, burning a mix CD and giving it to our friends&#45;&#45;this is beyond the pale. And as many news sources are beginning to point out, there&#8217;s some reason to think <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/rants/0,2350,69467,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_5" target="new">it might also be illegal</a>, under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/g/bg_left.gif" /></p>

<p>Ever ask yourself questions about the birth of RSS, XML, online advertising, O’Rielly Publishing, Archive.org, or even the internet in general?  Well, I just recently discovered <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/">NerdTV</a>, an IPTV show (meaning… internet only TV show) done by tech writer Robert X Cringley (the same guy who has done numerous other PBS technology specials.  Go Netflix <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70014652&amp;trkid=189530">Triumph of the Nerds</a>).  In each episode of NerdTV, Cringley brings you a 1 hour, unedited interview with the innovators, the movers, and the shakers in the computer industry over the last 20 years.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say it is for everyone because if you are not familiar with those terms mentioned above and you aren&rsquo;t particularly interested in learning, NerdTV might not be for you.  However, if the stories telling the birth of computing and the technologies that rule our lives today interest you, then odds are you will find these interviews wildly fascinating.</p>

<p>So far, Cringley has brought the following interviews…
Dan Drake &ndash; Autodesk Co-founder
Dave Winer &ndash; Father of RSS and Web Logging
Tim O&#8217;Reilly &ndash; Open Source Publishing Pioneer
Brewster Kahle &ndash; Internet Archive Founder
Bill Joy &ndash; Sun Microsystems Co-founder
Max Levchin &ndash; Co-founder of PayPal
Andy Hertzfeld &ndash; The first Macintosh programmer&hellip;ever</p>

<p>Even if you are merely interested in the business side of technology (not necessarily the technology behind the businesses), the interview with 29 year old Levchin (who is now worth ~$500 Million) was very compelling.  Take him back 35 years to the days when the PC was born, and it would be him running Microsoft today, not Bill Gates.  He’s that imaginative, that business savvy, and that determined.  As Gates has shown, an engineer with business skills, and a drive to succeed at everything he tries can be a lethal combination.  Here is a (not so) brief excerpt on selecting the &ldquo;Next Big Thing&rdquo; in technology to demonstrate the value in listening to this guy.</p>

<blockquote> Now, so how do you select a new wave? What do you look for?

Max Levchin: I think the thing you do is you sort of try to keep track of what&#8217;s going on. And you try to learn about or take in the trends that are going on. So I think to take the metaphor further, there are tremors in the ocean floor that are trends of things. Like people watch less TV and use more computers. And people have digital cameras now that cost them nothing because they come with their phones. And these are not really waves, they&#8217;re just sort of truths about bandwidth being cheaper, etc. And they shake the ocean floor and a wave starts.

And then a wave turns out to be something like everyone needs to share images, cause they&#8217;re making so much more of them. And everyone needs to do something more than just stare into their computer for Excel and Word, because they&#8217;re really staring a lot. And everyone needs a better search engine, because they have more time and more bandwidth to spend through their computers. So you sometimes watch those waves emerge and you go, oh, man, that&#8217;s a big one. As you watch, some company synthesized those trends into a wave, and sometimes, if you&#8217;re smart and lucky, you say oh, this is - the shaking is going on. I think there&#8217;ll be a wave over there.

And you get your surfboard out and you paddle, and probably most of the time you realize that you&#8217;re going exactly the opposite way from wherever you want to be, and you lick your wounds and you go back to the ocean floor watching. But on occasion if you&#8217;re persistent enough you probably find yourself on top of a wave, or at least somewhere on the crest, and you try to stand on the board. I&#8217;ve beaten the surfing metaphor to death, but I like it.</blockquote>


<p>.</p>

<p>It very well could be the interviews Cringley has chosen thus far, but the more of these stories you listen to, the more common themes develop, and the more you notice personality trends throughout these industry leaders.  You can of course pick out the obvious in that they are all nerds, but look a bit deeper and you&rsquo;ll see a strange mix of wild imagination, and both competitiveness and generosity.  Don&rsquo;t be shocked&hellip; this is the same trait you see throughout the history of the computer industry.  Remember, the computer was born in 1970s by the social outcasts who were often times in line with the “share everything” hippy movement.  Software programs were not initially sold, but rather shown off as a badge of pride in saying “Look what I did and you couldn&rsquo;t do.”  That is a stark contrast to where we are today.  The thing that fuels their motivation isn&rsquo;t money (Bill Gates), ego (Steve Jobs), or power (Gates &amp; Jobs), it does include those, but it also includes the aspect of being proud of your work, your ideas, and sharing them with the world.</p>

<p>In watching the NerdTV interviews and Cringley&rsquo;s other specials, you see the exact same people making the industry happen, and for what reason?  In their words… &ldquo;to change the world.&rdquo;  You hear that bold reason in nearly every interview.  Why?  Well… there’s a reason, and due to it’s length it will likely another post at some point.  But it is also the same reason that exists today and is a prime motivating factor driving the revolution of Open Source Software, which quite honestly is unlike anything you see in other industries.  It is millions of programmers, writing code, and donating it to the world, for what in return?  Nothing.  Sure it is possible to get high paying consulting jobs, doing what you love, with some of the best companies in the industry (see: Firefox &amp; Gaim developers now working for Google).  But to me, that is the beauty of programming and the computer industry today.  One person, with one good idea, can in fact change the world, and these people realized that decades ago.  There are currently products being developed right now that will have the same impact that Windows did, that VisiCalc did, and Bulletin Board software did.  Where and what are they?  Who knows.  In a recent podcast from Dave Winer (Morning Coffee Talk: Sept. 30th), he said the times we are in now are just like the times 20 years ago when he was in the thick of the software revolution.  It is his opinion that users &amp; developers are once again, working together, to create historic ideas, which in the end can change the landscape of the computing industry.  Should be fun. =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One top of all the other <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/">bad decisions</a> and the PR nightmare Sony has created for themselves&hellip;  the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004145.php">has a great write-up</a> of the more unbelievable terms in the 3,000 word UELA you agree to when you purchase Sony CDs.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite ones&hellip;
&ldquo;<strong>Sony-BMG can install and use backdoors in the copy protection software or media player to &#8220;enforce their rights&rdquo; against you, at any time, without notice.</strong> And Sony-BMG disclaims any liability if this &ldquo;self help&rdquo; crashes your computer, exposes you to security risks, or any other harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>If you file for bankruptcy, you have to delete all the music on your computer.</strong> Seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>If your house gets burgled, you have to delete all your music from your laptop when you get home.</strong> That&rsquo;s because the EULA says that your rights to any copies terminate as soon as you no longer possess the original CD.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>If you move out of the country, you have to delete all your music.</strong> The EULA specifically forbids &#8220;export&rdquo; outside the country where you reside.&#8221;</p>

<p>A product better be reeaaaalllly damn cool if I am going to give my money to Sony ever again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brad Neuberg has published <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/10/26/ajax-handling-bookmarks-and-back-button.html?page=1">an article</a> on O&#8217;Rielly&rsquo;s OnJava.com.  In this, he presents a solution that has long hampered AJAX web development.  When using GMail, ever accidently click the back/forward button out of habit only to leave the gmail site?  It is quite an annoying reality that we&rsquo;ve had to live with because nobody had been able to fix how to navigate around abstract applications like Gmail.  Well now, at least one solution has been presented.  In quickly looking through the code, everything appears to make sense, but it seems like it might be a bit tricky to implement.  Check out two of the demos <a href="http://www.onjava.com/onjava/2005/10/26/examples/examples/simple/simple.html">here </a>and <a href="http://www.onjava.com/onjava/2005/10/26/examples/examples/oreillymail/oreillymail.html#section:allmail">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is interesting because just last night I was listening to one of the recent Web 2.0 podcasts and one of the hosts or the interviewee (a Flock developer) said the AJAX/history button problem lied a bit further upstream and was something the browser developers would have to fix.  While that would be optimal as it would not require use to code the hack, I wouldn&rsquo;t even know how they could begin fixing that issue.</p>

<p>Let the true web applications begin!</p>

<p>Gotta run.  Time to head to Lawrence to watch my Jayhawks kick a little Tiger tail in a few hours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do you get when you combine EBay, Craigslist, upcoming.org, monster.com, match.com, and many others?  It appears to be <a href="http://base.google.com">Google Base</a>.  It hasn&rsquo;t officially launched yet, so those services are merely speculation.  However, the likes of those services has been <a href="http://ebaystrategies.blogs.com/ebay_strategies/">the buzz</a> lately.</p>

<p>Now it is becoming more clear as to why EBay bought Skype, because Google now has everything EBay has (and a ton more).  They will both have VoIP (GoogleTalk &amp; Skype), Auctions (Base &amp; Ebay), Classifieds (Base &amp; Craigslist which Ebay owns part of/Half.com), and a payment system (Paypal &amp; soon to be released Google Wallet).</p>

<p>The difference between the two?  Google = free.  As long as Google has eyeballs looking at their ads, they&rsquo;ll release every one of their products for free.  Base won&rsquo;t need it&rsquo;s own revenue stream.  Ebay on the other hand has no revenue stream if they don&rsquo;t charge for postings.</p>

<p>This should also be interesting with the hyped <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> that was talked about months ago that still has yet to launch.  Base will have events, so&hellip; log in and Calendar them.  They will likely also be sending out RSS feeds for listings, so&hellip;. throw them in the recently launched <a href="www.google.com/reader">RSS Reader</a>.  Want to talk to a listing poster?  <a href="www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> or <a href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail </a>&lsquo;em.  Then of course&hellip; want another product like the one you are looking at?  Look on the right side of the screen for those &ldquo;Ads by Google.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next few should be a huge couple months for Google.  Now that they have pretty much all the basic services, time to kick it in full gear.  Next up&hellip; Google&rsquo;s entry into media (<a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> is just the beginning), Google Office, Google WiFi, GMail 2.0 (they are about to be killed by Yahoo &amp; Microsoft&rsquo;s new email apps), Google Online (after they buy AOL &amp; give away internet access) &amp; then the king of them all&hellip; Google OS, your new web based operating system that can run from any computer in the world.</p>

<p>Meet your new Overlord.</p>
