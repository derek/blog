  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the outpouring of help for the  tsunami victims last winter, a <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Hurricane_Katrina/0,,2-10-1942_1764587,00.html">similiar effort</a> may be coming to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Is a dying city actually going to see that?  Maybe, maybe not.  Even though many countries are graciously offering their assistance and specifically stating what they will provide, Bush refuses to accept their offers at this point.  He has already <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/09/us-refuses-jamaicas-offer-to-help-with.html">turned away Canadian &amp; Jamaican assistance</a> and we&rsquo;ll see if the administration follows suit with these offers as well.  Why?  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll claim security reasons and use the buzzword of the century (terrorism), which is a pathetic excuse.</p>

<p>This is just a continuance of what has amounted to a man-made natural disaster.  The natural disaster part was of course the hurricane, but the damages incurred were only magnified by human neglect before, and after the hurricane.  Last Sunday, the National Geographic Channel aired a few hours of natural disaster programs, showing not only what has happened, but what can happen.  During one of these segments, they used the tsunami to jump into a &ldquo;What-if&rdquo; scenario in New Orleans.  What if a hurricane or tidal wave broke the levee and flooded the city?  I was shocked at the scenario and stunned to learn that it would infact happen if a class 5 (possibly even class 4) hurricane made a direct hit on New Orleans.  Well, the next day it happened.</p>

<p>President bush stated on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/09/01/BL2005090100915.html">Good Morning America</a></p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees. They did anticipate a serious storm. But these levees got breached. And as a result, much of New Orleans is flooded. And now we are having to deal with it and will.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>Sorry, the worst case scenario was considered and prepared for.  FEMA started stockpiling food &amp; water in strategic locations in New Orleans days before (allegedly).  Hell, even the lump of clay <a href="http://crawfordslist.blogspot.com/2005/09/oh-no-mr-bill-knew-so-why-didnt.html">Mr. Bill knew this was inevitable</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of FEMA, how can this entire situation be handled so poorly when plans &amp; scenarios for this specific catastrophe have already been thought up, and exercises conducted?  Listen to NPR&rsquo;s Robert Siegel tear Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff a new one as to why FEMA&rsquo;s efforts have been so abysmal (<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4828771">link</a>).</p>

<p>Another reason why could be the organization&rsquo;s director Michael Brown has shown in his incompetence in running FEMA.  Rep. Robert Wexler <a href="http://www.jewishsightseeing.com/dhh_weblog/2005-blog/2005-01-blog/2005-01-26-wexler-fema.htm">urged President Bush to fire Brown</a> in January for improperly handing out $30 million to Dade County for Hurricane Frances damages.  Well, Hurricane Frances didn&rsquo;t even hit Dade country, but rather 100 miles away.  It turns out Brown doesn&rsquo;t have the greatest track record in the world.  His last position was director of the International Arabian Horse Association where his performance was &ldquo;An unmitigated, total fucking disaster.  I was shocked as hell when captain clueless put him in charge of FEMA a couple of years ago.&rdquo; (<a href="http://storiesinamerica.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/2/34622/68348">link</a>).  Glad to know a regions fate and countless lives lie in the hands of his ability, or inability, to mobilize the rescue efforts.</p>

<p>Watching Fox News today (CNN was at commercial), they decided to take this opportunity to push their &ldquo;Destroy the Alaska Wildlife Refuge so we Can Drive our Hummers&rdquo; agenda by bringing on panelists to debate the topic.  Of course they bring in lobbyists and oil execs to face off against a nobody conservationist who Neil Cavuto discredited anything that came out of her mouth.  So, with Fox News always good for entertainment, there have been a few clips surface on the internet of the media&rsquo;s take of this whole fiasco.  One of them being Geraldo and Shepard Smith being dumbfounded as to why this whole situation is being handled so poorly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/media/katrina/Hannity-Colmes-Smith-Rivera-freak-in-NO.wmv"><img src="http://www.crooksandliars.com/images/2005/09/02/Geraldo-Rivera.jpg" alt="" />
download</a></p>

<p>Another clip that I came across was Anderson Cooper tearing into Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu on her political back patting and the government&rsquo;s lack of effort.  I found it quite entertaining and Cooper has been one of the more vocal members of the media about how appalling this whole situation is.  I, along with the rest of the people with actual hearts, thank him for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/media/katrina/Anderson-Cooper-Landrieu-Katrina1.wmv"><img src="http://www.crooksandliars.com/images/2005/09/01/Cooper-Landrieu.jpg" alt="" />
download</a></p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t one person down there helping out that isn&rsquo;t giving their best effort, and they&rsquo;ve already saved countless lives.  The problem here lies with the management and their inability to properly lead these rescue efforts.  Herding people into the dome and the convention center through the hurricane was a good idea.  Forcing them to stay there for 6 days with little or no food or water while garbage, human waste, and unfortunately human corpses, piled up was not.  Reports say that much of the New Orleans police force just gave up and left the city because there was little or no communication or leadership in telling them what they should be doing.</p>

<p>Many people fall back to the argument that there is a time and a place to point fingers and play the blame game, and it isn&rsquo;t now.  Well guess what?  If nobody speaks out, if Geraldo in typical Geraldo fashion doesn&rsquo;t over-dramatically hold a crying baby in his arms, if Cooper doesn&rsquo;t attack a political leader in her home state and hopefully motivates her to do more, if the blogosphere doesn&rsquo;t explode with these stories, and we sit on our hands waiting for this man-made disaster to stabilize, more people will suffer and more people will die.  Hopefully with the airlift out of the convention center occurring today, 4 days too late I might add, the worst is over and these people can begin an attempt at piecing back together their shattered lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div style="float:left"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lchNosi.jpg" height="400" style="margin-right:1em; padding-top:5px;"></div>


<p>What do you get when you find some of the most testosterone fueled men (who are quadriplegic by the way), put them in a wheelchair (which is more like a battering ram), and give them a ball?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_rugby">Quad-rugby</a>.</p>

<p>Quad-rugby is a sport that has been around for just over a decade, and while very intriguing, has gone largely unnoticed.  You would think that feel good stories like this would be covered on the new magazine shows, or especially ESPN who loves to air 10 minute “overcoming-the-odds”  stories on Sunday night SportsCenter, but apparently not.</p>

<p>You would also think that the new documentary film covering this sport and its participants, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436613">Murderball</a>, would be one of those transcending-the-genre documentaries (like &ldquo;Hoop Dreams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bowling for Columbine&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fahrenheit 9/11&rdquo;, &ldquo;Super Size Me&rdquo;), but nope.  Mysteriously, it is going largely unseen in indy theaters nationwide and is being dropped left &amp; right.  In KC, the Tivoli, Glenwood Arts, and Screenland have all dropped it.</p>

<p>There were obviously many things to learn from this movie.  First off, I learned that being quadriplegic doesn&rsquo;t mean you lost all movement from the neck down, it just means you are impaired to some degree.  Another being that while paralysis is something most every person fears to death, there are people out there that excel at coping with their disability, and this is their story.  Amazingly, one interviewee said that he wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.  When asked if he could undo what happened, Team USA captain Mark Zupan replied &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. My injury has led me to opportunities and experiences and friendships I would never have had before. And it has taught me about myself.  In some ways, it&rsquo;s the best thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo;  Many people think that paralysis would be the end of your life, and this movie points out that sometimes that can be brutally true, but it can also be the start of a new one.</p>

<div style="float:right"><img src="http://imgur.com/nQtU15V.jpg" height="400" style="margin-left:1em; padding-top:5px;"></div>


<p>While it is a sports movie, Murderball mostly covers everything about these athletes not related to the sport; their accidents/diseases that let to their situation, their jobs, their families, how they learned to cope with their injuries, and yes… even how they have sex.</p>

<p>So who are these guys?  A KC Star movie critic said it best&hellip; &ldquo;These guys don&rsquo;t want your pity, they want your girlfriend.&rdquo;  Having known (non-quad) rugby players in the past, one thing is apparent to me&hellip; rugby players are an interesting breed.  It&rsquo;s even more apparent that rugby is more a mindset than simply a sport because these quad-rugby athletes are exactly the same guys I&rsquo;ve known who play the non-quad version.</p>

<p>Think you can’t party hard, get drunk, talk shit, start fights, and get gorgeous women as a quadriplegic?  Think again.  These guys do it all, and on gameday, beat the crap out of each other with their $3,000 custom made wheelchairs.  How have they managed to land their hot wives/girlfriends?  First off, Zupan’s girlfriend claimed the wheelchair and the sport intrigues many women initially and then the motherly instinct kicks in.  In contrast, one player bluntly put it this way… “The more pitiful you look, the easier it is to get laid.”</p>

<p>As I was leaving the theater, a girl behind me asked her husband what he thought, he said &ldquo;I definitely shed a tear or two.&rdquo;  So I guess you can lump this in with Old Yeller and Brian’s Song as movies it is ok for guys to cry in.</p>

<p>So there you go&hellip; Easily one of the best documentaries I’ve seen, and it really opens up your eyes to a whole new world, which from my experience, is a true sign of a great documentary.</p>

<p>On a side note, I saw this film at <a href="http://www.screenland.com">Screenland</a> and it is awesome!  Leather recliners, a great vintage film atmosphere, and not to far from my loft makes this one of my new favorite theaters in KC.  Oh, and they also have a liquor license which makes it the first theater that I’ve been to that actually serves alcohol.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recieved an email from Richard Lawrence, the <a href="http://avantslash.org/">AvantSlash</a> author, and apparently his webhost wiped his account which deleted among many things, the AvantSlash 3.1 script.  Being #2 when googling &ldquo;AvantSlash&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve been getting a number of people either emailing me asking if I have a copy of 3.0 or 3.1, and unfortunately I don&rsquo;t.  But being, the internet, I believe it has to be out there somewhere, so I&rsquo;m hoping this message will be read by someone who can help out.</p>

<p>If you have the script, you can me an email and I&rsquo;ll pass it along.  As a programmer, I know how awful it would be to lose a project that you&rsquo;ve spent so much time on, especially one that people really love, so dig through your hard-drives and see if you can find it.  The archive filename will likely be avantslash.zip.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are looking for a running AvantSlash page for your cellphone/pda/whatever, you can either Google &ldquo;avantify.cgi&rdquo; and find a number of them.  Or, I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://meanbusiness.com/cgi-bin/avantify.cgi">http://meanbusiness.com/cgi-bin/avantify.cgi</a>.  Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Richard emailed to let me know that a number of people have found the script and have sent it to him. Great work everyone! So don&rsquo;t worry about emailing the files anymore, just send him a thank you email telling him how awesome Avantslash is. =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/?p=27">mentioned it</a> on here before, but <a href="http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/avantslash/">AvantSlash</a> is one of my favorite web apps and now it appears <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> doesn&rsquo;t quite approve of its place in the world wide web, so they banned its IP.  For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar with it, if you want to visit <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> on your low-resolution browser (PDA or cell phone), it&rsquo;s great because it strips out all the pictures, ads, unnecesary links, etc&hellip;  All it gives you is what you want, the stories and the discussion, perfectly formatted.  While Slashdot does have <a href="http://slashdot.org/palm">their own &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version</a>, it is pretty sub-par with limited stories per page and 5 comments.</p>

<p>Other websites have done similiar things before and sometimes limit the content of their RSS feeds (i.e. Slashdot doesn&rsquo;t include the latest story with feeds), because after all, they own the content, and I&rsquo;m fine with that.  However, for the bastion of open-source and creative sharing on the internet, it seems rather hipocritical to take an action like this.  Especially considering their stance on stories and comments (contributions are unedited and owned by the contributor) it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to ban users from reading stories which you claim not to own in the first place.  You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>Luckily, you can still <a href="http://freshmeat.net/redir/avantslash/49789/url_zip/avantslash.zip">download the source code</a> and run it on your own server.</p>

<p>Gotta say, I&rsquo;m a bit dissapointed.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  It appears that the ban has been lifted.  I&rsquo;m guessing that it was unintentional to begin with as they do <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/faq/accounts.shtml#ac1050">ban users</a> for hammering their rss feed.  No exect word on what happened, but the avantslash site does say this&hellip; <em>&ldquo;Two severe bugs crept into the 3.0 release relating to the way that AvantSlash handles requests for out-of-date pages and caching. Use of version 3.0 will generate excessive requests to the Slashdot server and get your IP banned.  As such, it is highly recommended to update to v3.1 which resolves these issues.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After last week&rsquo;s resurrection of <a href="/blog/posts/blast-from-the-past/">some old coding projects</a>, this week I bring you my <a href="/blog/media/portfolio.avi">animation portfolio</a>! Wow, I haven&rsquo;t looked at this stuff in at least 4 or 5 years.  The timestamps on the files were from &lsquo;97 &amp; &#8216;98.  Ah&hellip; good ol&rsquo; 3D Studio Max R2.  I think I actually may have done some of these on 3d Studio R4 which wasn&rsquo;t even a Windows program (it ran in DOS).  Sorry about the crappy quality, I rendered these on a P3-333mhz system with probably 64 megs of ram, and they took all night long.  If I bumped up the quality, that would have tacked on another week of rendering time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I realized how useful it is to code pages for cell phone use, another idea popped into my head.  I constantly visit <a href="http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/avantslash/live/avantify.cgi">AvantSlash</a> on my cell phone because <a href="http://slashdot.org/palm">http://slashdot.org/palm</a> sucks.  So why not make another geek favorite site cell-phone-friendly too?  I bring you <a href="mobile%20Bash.org">misc/bash.php</a>, something that took a whole 5 minutes to code thanks to the great work already done with the <a href="http://www.bash.org/xml/about.html">Bash.org RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Now enjoy the stupidity of IRC chatting at your fingertips wherever you go.  So be sure to bookmark it on your phone/PDA for whenever you get bored.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I finally got around to giving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a> (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) a whirl.  I started out just wanting to allow people to send me text messages via the side bar of this blog and got it working (with PHP) in about 2 minutes, but then I thought&hellip; &ldquo;It works, but I hate reloading the page for something so simple.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s when AJAX popped in my head and it seemed like a great first script.</p>

<p>So off I went to grab the latest version of <a href="http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/">SAJAX</a> (Simple Ajax), and boy were they right about the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; part.  Within about 30 minutes, I had a functional script that you can now find on the side bar.  Before you try it out, please use the <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/ajax_send_mail.php">demo page</a>, as I don&rsquo;t need everyone sending me text messages just to see how it works.</p>

<p>Next step, getting my responses to show up!</p>

<p>Edit:  At first that last comment was a joke, <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/chat_full.php">but two hours later&hellip;</a>, that was shockingly easy.  I&rsquo;d like to get it integrated into the side bar, but out of time tonight.  I&rsquo;ll post the code when I have a bit more time to work on it.  So feel free to send a message or two, as I can respond rather easily.  If you get annoying, I can turn it off via my cell phone too.</p>
