Then, Facebook said “No, we’re holding out for $2.5 billion?”, and people thought FB was absolutely nuts?  Well, fast-forward the clock, Facebook is now open, not only to non-college students, but also “open” as in an open development platform that anyone can develop applications for.  Now, Microsoft is considering buying them…</p>

<p>One estimate puts FB at a $10 Billion (Yes, with a B).  At first, that seems like an insanely high number, but then factor into the equation FB’s goal to create a social map of the world and their business savvy leaders, and well… ok, $10 Billion still seems insanely high.  But hey, if M$ wants to spend that much money, they can, and people will call them crazy, like they will.  Read on and you’ll find this gem, “Facebook has indicated that it might hold out for a higher valuation – as much as $15 billion” WTF?!?!  $300 Million (profit) / $15 Billion = 50 P/E ratio.  And FYI, Google’s P/E ratio is currently at 48.</p>
<p>So there you go Google, Facebook considers itself more valuable than you, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/social/?p=314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go get ‘em</a>.</p>
