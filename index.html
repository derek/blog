<p><a href="https://github.com/derek/yui-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YUI Benchmark</a> is a new toolkit for JavaScript performance testing. Despite “YUI” being in the name, it can be used for any type of JavaScript application, including vanilla JS, YUI, Dojo, jQuery, Node.js, and anything else you can think of. The project was something I was working on at Yahoo to help with YUI’s CI performance testing needs, and since its quiet open-sourcing a few weeks ago, I’ve <a href="http://derek.io/blog/2013/on-leaving-yahoo/">had some time</a> to clean it up, fix bugs, and introduce some new functionality.</p>

<p>So you want to learn JavaScript huh? I can’t blame you, it’s a pretty rad programming language.  Well lucky for you, it’s a really easy language to pick up and learn.  You can get started with the language without spending a penny on a compiler, an IDE, or any instructional material.  Heck, you already have a computer capable of running JavaScript.  I know that because every modern web browser has one, and that’s how you are viewing this blog post.</p></div><a href="/blog/2011/learning-javascript/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2011/the-best-career-advice-you-ll-ever-get/" class="post-title-link">The Best Career Advice You'll Ever Get</a></h2><div class="post-info">Jul 7, 2011</div><div class="post-content"><p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qwkp2Um.png" alt="career advice"><br>The Huffington Post just posted an interview with Marissa Mayer (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/google-marissa-mayer-women-in-tech_n_891167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>“Google Exec Marissa Mayer Explains Why There Aren’t More Girl Geeks”</em></a>) in which she explained why she chose Google over 13 other companies she had job offers from out of college.</p></div><a href="/blog/2011/the-best-career-advice-you-ll-ever-get/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2011/splitt/" class="post-title-link">Splitt</a></h2><div class="post-info">Jun 10, 2011</div><div class="post-content"><p>Growing up in Kansas City, I spent quite a few summer afternoons at Royals games.

It makes sense that Apple would  want to buy the next best thing and get some great engineers in the process.   However, I didn’t think at the time that Apple’s strategy would become so clear, so soon.  Apple’s acquisitions usually take years to come to fruition.  Not this time though. TechCrunch recently reported that Apple is planning on transforming iTunes into a cloud-based iTunes.com service, and Lala’s technology is the quickest way to do that.
