<p>Sprint, as a brand, is pretty much dead. I can’t believe how badly Gary Forsee crippled that company. They purchased Nextel for $35 billion just three years ago, destroyed its network and fractured its customer base, and are now trying to sell it for a measly $5 billion while the FCC says it must relocate to a different spectrum, likely costing billions. Meanwhile, their landline services have since been spun-off as Embarq, and this <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/06/clearwire-wimax-32-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest move</a> to offload its future 4G operation to Clearwire is an indication that the end is near.</p>
<p>So now they’ll turn around and sell Nextel, crippling that poor brand even more and leaving it as a shell of what it once was. At that point, all “Sprint” will have left is a backbone ISP operation, a dying wireless brand that will likely <a href="http://blog.derekville.net/2008/05/05/sprint-dumping-nextel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be sold to T-Mobile</a>, investments in all of the spin-offs, and an arena that still doesn’t have an NBA team. (Humor for the KC readers)</p>
<p>Goodbye “Sprint”, I’m not sure what you’ll be in 5 years. 100+ year old companies don’t just dissapear into thin air, but I don’t think you’ll be very recognizable. Again, I’m talking about “Sprint” the brand.  Sprint the stock ticker is a great investment right now as I’ve been preaching the last couple months.  If you do still have your wireless voice services, I’m sure it will be under a commodity / white label brand until the current technology dies and eventually you’ll sell your shares in all your spin-offs to pay off the debt you racked up.</p>
<p>But, having said that, I think the move makes perfect sense and is a well played strategy. Sprint &amp; Clearwire’s WiMAX project has great potential, but they have no money to fund it since Clearwire is only 4 years old and Sprint is $20 billion in debt, so they absolutely needed to join forces. Along with the new merger, they will also get an influx of much needed cash from Comcast, Intel, Time Warner, &amp; Google, who are throwing in a $3.2 Billion investment.</p>
<p>So, the landscape is now set for The Great Wireless Broadband War of 2008-2014 (can I trademark that?)</p>
<p><strong>Side A</strong><br>A) Sprint - Owns a large chunk of the back-end of the internet<br>B) Google - Owns a large chunk of the front-end of the internet<br>C) Comcast &amp; Time Warner - Owns cable television &amp; residential internet in the US<br>D) Intel - Owns the processors that will power everything<br>E) Skype - <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/4/ebay_selling_skype_to_google_let_us_pray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assuming Google buys it</a></p>
<p><strong>Side B</strong><br>A) AT&amp;T vs Verizon - Dominant telcos in US who are launching their own 4G network sometime <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/04/verizon-announces-700mhz-lte-plans-can-you-wait-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next</a> <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/04/03/atandt-says-b-block-and-aloha-spectrum-will-go-to-lte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decade</a>.<br>B) British Telecom - Dominant telco in UK<br>C) NTT - Dominant telco in Japan<br>D) Deutsch Telecom - Dominant telco in Germany<br>E) <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/06/global-telcos-plotting-a-skype-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unnamed Skype Killer</a> they are rumored to be working on to run on their closed networks.</p>
<p>So who will win? That’s a tough one, but here are some suggested investments; CLWR, S, GOOG, &amp; INTC. Openness wins in the digital world.</p>
