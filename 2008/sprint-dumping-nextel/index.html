<p>Considering how many customers they’ve lost due to outages since the merger, it’s clear that move was the worst idea in Sprint’s history.</p>
<p>So, their stock is up ~75% from where it was since I told you to buy it a few weeks back. Hopefully you listened to me. If not, it’s still not too late, Deutsche Telekom is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2008/gb2008055_779933.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking to buy them</a> which would give it quite a boost.</p>
<p>Best scenario would be for Sprint to dump Nextel somehow, in turn making themselves more attractive for a Deutsche Telekom/T-Mobile purchase, then merge the two and become the #1 US cell carrier. Whose network the customers go to doesn’t matter, T-Mobile’s more compatible GSM would be preferable though. Sure, you won’t have any offerings to compete with AT&amp;T and Verizon’s wired internet and cable TV offerings (FiOS &amp; uVerse), but who cares, you’ll have a great headstart over them in the wireless broadband market, which is obviously where the future is. Finally, embed Sprint Xohm chips in everything from laptops to VoIP phones to toasters, and print money uncontested. But most importantly, differentiate the labels, market the voice service as T-Mobile and the data as Sprint/Xohm because both are used for very different purposes.</p>
<p>Glass half empty says Sprint is fucked. Glass half full says the worst is over, your current model sucks, so time to move on to something new &amp; innovative.</p>
