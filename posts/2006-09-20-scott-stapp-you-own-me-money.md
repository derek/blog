Yes! I found the evidence I've been looking for all these years.  Now I am finally going to prove that Scott Stapp's band "Creed" was simply living off the fame my band in junior high garnered around the greater Olathe, KS area.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="creed" href="http://www.derekgathright.com/images/creed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.derekgathright.com/images/creed.jpg" alt="creed" width="571" height="428" /></a></p>

April '96?  The other Creed's debut album didn't come out until 16 months later.  I'll take my check anytime Scott.

(FYI, I'm the one playing drums)
