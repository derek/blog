<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051111/ap_on_hi_te/sony_copy_protection">Yahoo has an article</a> about how three trojan horse viruses have been found that exploit the massive serurity hole left by Sony's rootkit.  It also reports a class action lawsuit has already been filed, and the EFF is looking into filing another.  As I blogged earlier, it is in their EULA that they can install whatever they want, but EULAs have been shot down in court before, so let's hope this one is as well.

UPDATE: Somewhat UELA related story on TechDirt. <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20051110/1412200_F.shtml">Can Malware Firms Use EULAs To Ban Security Firms From Stopping Spyware?</a>
