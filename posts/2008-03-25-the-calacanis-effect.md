<p>Some people have been wondering how much having Jason Calacanis link to your blog in his twitter feed (twice) and his <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2008/03/24/amazing-mahalo-feedback-from-derek/" target="_blank">blog</a>?&#160; Well, some initial numbers from the last 24 hours...</p>  <ul>   <li>About 70 new Twitter followers.&#160; With each of his two tweets directed at me, I instantly gained about 15 new followers, and then the rest scattered in throughout the rest of the day.</li>    <li>910 new visits to my blog with 1.36 pages/visit</li>    <li>The viddler video now has 650+ views from my blog, and another 600+ views on the viddler site.</li> </ul>  <p>Any other statistics people were wondering?</p>
