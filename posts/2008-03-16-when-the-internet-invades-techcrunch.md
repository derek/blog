<p>Due to <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo Buzz</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/15/japanese-isps-to-ban-file-sharers/" target="_blank">this</a> TechCrunch article appeared on the Yahoo.com homepage, and wow... 1000+ comments later it's almost as if mom &amp; dad went away for the weekend and the kids trashed the house.&#160; Talk about some of the most clueless commenters ever.</p>  <p>TechCrunch did a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/16/yahoo-buzz-yahoo-reveals-stats-from-the-first-two-weeks/" target="_blank">follow-up</a> that analyzes Buzz's impact two weeks in.&#160; Yahoo says they've sent 16 million users from the site in those two weeks and have given pretty much every site it links to record traffic.&#160; TechCrunch, a highly trafficked Tech news site could hardly stay up.</p>  <p>It'll be interesting to see the implications of Buzz and how many servers it can melt.</p>
