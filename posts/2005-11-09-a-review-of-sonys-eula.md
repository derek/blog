One top of all the other [bad decisions](http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/) and the PR nightmare Sony has created for themselves... the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) [has a great write-up](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004145.php) of the more unbelievable terms in the 3,000 word UELA you agree to when you purchase Sony CDs.

Some of my favorite ones...
"**Sony-BMG can install and use backdoors in the copy protection software or media player to "enforce their rights" against you, at any time, without notice.** And Sony-BMG disclaims any liability if this "self help" crashes your computer, exposes you to security risks, or any other harm."

"**If you file for bankruptcy, you have to delete all the music on your computer.** Seriously."

"**If your house gets burgled, you have to delete all your music from your laptop when you get home.** That's because the EULA says that your rights to any copies terminate as soon as you no longer possess the original CD."

"**If you move out of the country, you have to delete all your music.** The EULA specifically forbids "export" outside the country where you reside."

A product better be reeaaaalllly damn cool if I am going to give my money to Sony ever again.
