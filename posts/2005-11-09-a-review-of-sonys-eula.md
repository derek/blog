One top of all the other <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/">bad decisions</a> and the PR nightmare Sony has created for themselves...  the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004145.php">has a great write-up</a> of the more unbelievable terms in the 3,000 word UELA you agree to when you purchase Sony CDs.

Some of my favorite ones...
"<strong>Sony-BMG can install and use backdoors in the copy protection software or media player to "enforce their rights" against you, at any time, without notice.</strong> And Sony-BMG disclaims any liability if this "self help" crashes your computer, exposes you to security risks, or any other harm."

"<strong>If you file for bankruptcy, you have to delete all the music on your computer.</strong> Seriously."

"<strong>If your house gets burgled, you have to delete all your music from your laptop when you get home.</strong> That's because the EULA says that your rights to any copies terminate as soon as you no longer possess the original CD."

"<strong>If you move out of the country, you have to delete all your music.</strong> The EULA specifically forbids "export" outside the country where you reside."

A product better be reeaaaalllly damn cool if I am going to give my money to Sony ever again.
