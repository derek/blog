Thanks to my date Lisa, as well as Sarah (Prom Queen) and her date for making the Second Chance Prom an awesome night.  And thanks to everyone out there for your support over the last few weeks.  Its been a ton of fun.

Well the fun isn't over yet, Sarah and my prize for being King &amp; Queen?  We each get a 7-day trip for two later on this month to the all inclusive Riu Caribe resort..

Works has to hate me though, hah.  17 days off in a matter of 30 days so I can go to Europe and Cancun.  Feel pretty guilty about that.
