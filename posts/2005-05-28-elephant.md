Having just finished watching the controversial film, "[Elephant](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363589/")", I'll have to say that it was a very good, and also a rather haunting movie in which people will either love or hate.  Some say this movie was Gus Van Sant attempting to portray the Columbine shootings, however I believe it is fairly obvious when watching the movie that it is was more inspired by Columbine <u>as well as</u> all the other high school shootings in recent years.   Those were events that really engrained the reality and trauma some kids endure throughout high school, and the actions they can sometimes take.

I must say, there was little point or purpose to the film except to take you into an average day of a High School, but it was filmed and depicted in a very artistic and poetic manner.  Events and characters in this movie were not meant to be taken literally, but they were more representations which should be taken in a symbolic nature.  The characters represented the stereotypes which you find at every high school.  The scenes depicted the boredom, the insecurity, and the self-indulgence in high-schoolers lives.  High school ended quite a while ago for me, but it is still fresh in my mind that I could easily finds parts of characters to relate to.  It was also relieving to see high-schoolers actually play high schoolers, and high school not portrayed as a perfect little world of beautiful people as you commonly find in movies and TV now days.

This movie was needed becuase we don't need a re-creation or a hollywood-esque movie with a dramatic 30 minute standoff and suicides at the end telling us what exactly happened that day at Columbine, or how to feel about the events that have happened at numerous other high schools.  Van Sant rather exposes us to the banality of high school life, and the tragedy that can occur and let's us make up our own mind and feelings about what is happening.  I highly recommend this film, but be warned, it's not for everyone.  You'll either love it or hate it.  If you liked Almost Famous, you'll like this.  If you liked Armegeddon, you'll hate it.  If you liked Garden State, you'll love this.  If you thought Con Air, Coyote Ugly, or Dude Where's My Car were good movies, you'll hate this.
