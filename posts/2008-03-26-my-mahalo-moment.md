So I had my 'Mahalo moment' yesterday, but, is it what Jason &amp; Mahalo expect?
<div align="center">
<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler_drgath_4"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/7ff3b31d/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/7ff3b31d/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler_drgath_4" ></embed></object>
</div>
For those looking for a good place to get an idea of what Mahalo is good at, here are some pages to get you started that I stumbled across or others suggested.Â  Please add some more links to pages in the comments to help people, like myself, who were completely clueless at what Mahalo was good at or useful for.<u>Good Mahalo links</u>

	<li><a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Maya_Angelou" title="Maya Angelou" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maya Angelou</a></li>
</ul>

In conclusion.  I think Mahalo, in it's current form, has a purpose and an audience, and that happens to not be the tech-savvy crowd who is serviced very well by Google right now.  In time, I think Mahalo will have the content tech-savvy users will want, but, will they provide an intelligent mechanism to get to it?  Hopefully.  Google & Wikipedia need some competition.
