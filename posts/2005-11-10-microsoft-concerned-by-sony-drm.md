<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1884677,00.asp">Paul Roberts reports on EWeek</a> that Microsoft  is considering 'taking action' against Sony with regards to its <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1880543,00.asp">rootkit</a> that has been all over the news recently.  This comes on top of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000890063698/">Microsoft claiming</a> Sony's next-gen DVD format (Blu-Ray) is "Anti-Consumer."  Anti-consumer?  Pot, meet kettle.  How many anti-trust lawsuits has Microsoft had slapped against them in the last few decades?  Still, I'm totally with them.  The Blu-Ray DRM is waaaaaay over the top.
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000737057152/">"Bricking" your Blu-Ray player for tinkering with it?</a>
<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1846104,00.asp">Dynamically updated copy protection schemes</a>
<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000420067137/">Discs locked in to one specific Blu-Ray player making it even "borrow-proof" between friends?</a>

I'm not going to sit here and defend anyone's right to copy intellectual property, but I'm not going to defend a companies right to have a monopoly over <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">innovation</a>, <a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000113.html">break my analog equipment</a> (<a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">here </a>also), and make the process of being entertained by watching a movie a nightmare of making sure my Blu-Ray player is hooked up to the internet before I am able to watch a movie so it can download the latest copy protection schemes, and renting a copy of a movie I already own just so I can watch it at a friends house.

Maybe it is just the geek in me, but watching Microsoft v. Sony throwdown would be entertaining as hell.  People seem to think Microsoft is a mindless power &amp; money hungry corporation, but Sony is 10 times worse.  When was the last time you heard about Microsoft suing people for pirating their $200-$300 software?  Ok, now when was the last time you heard about Sony &amp; the RIAA suing people for pirating $.99 songs?  Oh wait, $.99 is <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/05/09/30/2037203.shtml?tid=98&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=3">too little now for the RIAA </a>.
