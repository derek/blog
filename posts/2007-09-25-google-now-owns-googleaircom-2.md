Because of <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/2005/09/11/googleair/">this GoogleAir post</a> way back when, I've always gotten a ton of hits for the search query "Google Air".  When those started flooding in, I wondered who actually owned googleair.com, and from what I recall, it was some random company that I don't remember anything about.  Well, fast forward to the present day and I was curious to see if Google had taken ownership of googleair.com, and it looks like they have.  It doesn't go anywhere right now, and Google owns tons of domains that they probably never use (for copyright reasons), but I did find it interesting considering Google is looking to buy a big slice of the airwaves when the FCC auctions them off in a few months, and we've been hearing tons of rumors of a GooglePhone.
