Now that I realized how useful it is to code pages for cell phone use, another idea popped into my head.  I constantly visit [AvantSlash](http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/avantslash/live/avantify.cgi) on my cell phone because [http://slashdot.org/palm](http://slashdot.org/palm) sucks.  So why not make another geek favorite site cell-phone-friendly too?  I bring you [misc/bash.php](mobile Bash.org), something that took a whole 5 minutes to code thanks to the great work already done with the [Bash.org RSS feed](http://www.bash.org/xml/about.html).

Now enjoy the stupidity of IRC chatting at your fingertips wherever you go.  So be sure to bookmark it on your phone/PDA for whenever you get bored.
