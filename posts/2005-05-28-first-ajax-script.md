Well, I finally got around to giving [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) a whirl.  I started out just wanting to allow people to send me text messages via the side bar of this blog and got it working (with PHP) in about 2 minutes, but then I thought... "It works, but I hate reloading the page for something so simple."  That's when AJAX popped in my head and it seemed like a great first script.

So off I went to grab the latest version of [SAJAX](http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/) (Simple Ajax), and boy were they right about the "simple" part.  Within about 30 minutes, I had a functional script that you can now find on the side bar.  Before you try it out, please use the [demo page](http://www.derekgathright.com/ajax_send_mail.php), as I don't need everyone sending me text messages just to see how it works.

Next step, getting my responses to show up!

Edit:  At first that last comment was a joke, [but two hours later...](http://www.derekgathright.com/chat_full.php), that was shockingly easy.  I'd like to get it integrated into the side bar, but out of time tonight.  I'll post the code when I have a bit more time to work on it.  So feel free to send a message or two, as I can respond rather easily.  If you get annoying, I can turn it off via my cell phone too.
