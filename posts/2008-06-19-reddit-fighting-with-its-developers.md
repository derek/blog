Day #1 of Reddit <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html">going open source</a>, and they are already <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/reddit-dev/browse_thread/thread/82b3608b7c351106">fighting with their developers</a>.  C'mon guys, you clearly don't understand what is being requested, so ask for clarification instead of being so stubborn.  We understand you are busy getting this project off the ground, but you need to understand that you can't fight with your own developers, especially this early in the game.  If you can't manage that, they why did you open source it in the first place?
