I couldn't let Vin Deisel and Chuck Norris have all the fun nowdays with their own made up fact sites, so over the weekend I registered <a href="http://www.jackbauerfacts.com">jackbauerfacts.com</a> to commemorate the ultimate badass... Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland's character from Fox's "24").  In 3 days, it has already proven to be way more popular than I thought it would be.  Oddly enough, right after I registered the domain and started coding the site, I was getting hits before I had even told anyone about it!  People were just guessing the domain name apparently.

While it is one of the more useless sites on the internet (but then again... useless sites is mostly what the internet is about), I have some plans for it rather soon, ajax scripting, rating systems, and some other things as well.  Should be a nice playground for me to try out some new things with web application coding.  So anyways, check it out if you are in the mood for a few laughs.
