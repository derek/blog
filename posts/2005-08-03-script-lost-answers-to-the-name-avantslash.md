I recieved an email from Richard Lawrence, the [AvantSlash](http://avantslash.org/) author, and apparently his webhost wiped his account which deleted among many things, the AvantSlash 3.1 script.  Being #2 when googling "AvantSlash", I've been getting a number of people either emailing me asking if I have a copy of 3.0 or 3.1, and unfortunately I don't.  But being, the internet, I believe it has to be out there somewhere, so I'm hoping this message will be read by someone who can help out.

If you have the script, you can me an email and I'll pass it along.  As a programmer, I know how awful it would be to lose a project that you've spent so much time on, especially one that people really love, so dig through your hard-drives and see if you can find it.  The archive filename will likely be avantslash.zip.

In the meantime, if you are looking for a running AvantSlash page for your cellphone/pda/whatever, you can either Google "avantify.cgi" and find a number of them.  Or, I've been using [http://meanbusiness.com/cgi-bin/avantify.cgi](http://meanbusiness.com/cgi-bin/avantify.cgi).  Enjoy!

**UPDATE**: Richard emailed to let me know that a number of people have found the script and have sent it to him. Great work everyone! So don't worry about emailing the files anymore, just send him a thank you email telling him how awesome Avantslash is. =)
