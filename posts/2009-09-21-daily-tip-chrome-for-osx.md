<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.derekville.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/chromium-icon.png" alt="chromium-icon.png" border="0" width="128" height="128" /></div>

If you can't wait to get your hands on Chrome for OSX, go download a <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/LATEST/">Chromium nightly build</a>, unzip, and copy to your Applications folder.  

At first glance, it doesn't appear much different from Safari, which isn't too surprising since they're both based off the the same layout engine (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a>).  The real differences are just going to come in the skin (which is pretty similar) and the JavaScript engine (Chromium = V8, Safari = Nitro, formerly "Squirrelfish").
