<p>After Google lost out last week in it's bid for a stake in FaceBook, it's pretty apparent one of the reasons Facebook chose Microsoft instead was that Google is about to unleash a true contender to the stranglehold Facebook has on the social networking world.&nbsp; Later this week <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/details-revealed-google-opensocial-to-be-common-apis-for-building-social-apps/" target="_blank">Google will announce the OpenSocial API</a>, it's initiative to break down the walls of social networks exclusivity and open the data up for anyone to use.&nbsp; I can't comment to too much on how specifically it will work since the details have not emerged, but it's pretty apparent that the social networking world will now be MySpace, Facebook, and everyone else, with "everyone else" being part of OpenSocial.</p> <p>Facebook meanwhile is planning on launching it's own competitor for Google's AdSense with an upcoming announcement regarding its <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/facebook/facebook-socialads-ad-network-confirmed-316677.php" target="_blank">SocialAds network</a>.&nbsp; SocialAds will work by a cookie Facebook drops in your browser that follows you from site to site, and when you come across a SocialAds supported site, the (encrypted?) data is then sent to Facebook which in turn delivers an ad based on your profile.&nbsp; Interesting concept, but I'm not sure how useful basic profile information will be in tailoring ads towards things I'd like to buy.</p> <p>The next year should be fun as both companies, with egos like none other, try to out-do the other.</p>
