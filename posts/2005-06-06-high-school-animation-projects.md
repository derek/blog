    Wow amazingly enough I remember about half of these. I did get a 404 on mercuryg.avi.

    Your skills with 3d Studio Max are unmatchable.

After last week's resurrection of [some old coding projects](/posts/blast-from-the-past/), this week I bring you my [animation portfolio](/media/portfolio.avi)! Wow, I haven't looked at this stuff in at least 4 or 5 years.  The timestamps on the files were from '97 & '98.  Ah... good ol' 3D Studio Max R2.  I think I actually may have done some of these on 3d Studio R4 which wasn't even a Windows program (it ran in DOS).  Sorry about the crappy quality, I rendered these on a P3-333mhz system with probably 64 megs of ram, and they took all night long.  If I bumped up the quality, that would have tacked on another week of rendering time.

* [earthrse.avi](http://derekgathright.com/media/earthrse.avi): Ever wonder what it would be like to watch the earth rise while on the moon?  Well this doesn't do a very good job of depicting it.  Hah!

* [barn.avi](http://derekgathright.com/media/barn.avi): I have no idea what inspired this

* [rainstorm.mpg](http://derekgathright.com/media/rainstorm.mpg): Unfortunately I never really finished this one.  I intended for it to be much longer.

* [duck.avi](http://derekgathright.com/media/duck.avi): This was a fun one to do.

* [mercuryg.avi](http://derekgathright.com/media/mercuryg.avi): Another space one.  Why I thought Venus was blue... I don't know.

* [clacker.avi](http://derekgathright.com/media/clacker.avi): Never did spend the time to get the physics right on this one.

Oh, and I also used to do animations in high school for the video yearbook and the morning announcements.  Damn I was cool.
