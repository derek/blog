  content: "This might be the sexiest thing I saw since <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Appcelerator</a>! \r\n\r\nDerek, can you recommend any detailed
    articles related to server side Javascript and YQL? \r\n\r\nI have been hearing
    buzz about YQL for a while but I have been having a hard time finding a real good
    example of it's uses. I'd like to know what kind of power it has especially relating
    to API's and data interaction. I wonder if I could bring the power of YQL into
    my work-flow, centralizing my models around YQL would allow me to feel more comfortable
    writing query's and working with data the way I am used to.\r\n\r\nAfter working
    with Titanium for a couple months, I know how comfortable Javascript is when working
    user interaction and my data layer in the same language so I completely agree
    with you here. After reading your comment on Mailchimp's - <em>Ewww, you use PHP?</em>
    I had laughed to myself and burst out: for real! I wish I had time to roll my
    own!\r\n\r\nAfter reading that I figure I can respect that your recommendations;
    if you have any, will be good. I would love to play with what you are describing
    and am going to take a look at jsFiddle after reading your post.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for creating such a great resource!\r\nMike"

The more I play around with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, the more I love server-side JavaScript.  Once you get over the weirdness of writing JavaScript outside of the browser, it feels very natural.  And the bonus is that it is blazing fast.

<!-- more -->

Also, as I've been playing around with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a> (Yahoo Query Language) more lately, I realized I wanted to be able to access YQL data from within my Node app.  So, I created a <a href="http://github.com/drgath/node-yql">node-yql </a> module.

Now you can do something like...

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<pre lang="javascript">
YQL.get("SELECT * FROM weather.forecast WHERE location=90066", function(response) {

	var location  = response.query.results.channel.location,
	    condition = response.query.results.channel.item.condition;

	sys.puts("The current temperature in " + location.city + " is " + condition.temp + " degrees");
});
// Output: The current temperature in Los Angeles is 57 degrees
</pre>
