Now I don't speak legalease, and [their patent application](http://www.google.com/patents/US20070244837) reads like a foreign language, but if they just tried to patent making money off patents, then patent reform can't get here quick enough.

This is especially ironic since they pledged last year to [not seek business method patents](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/20325.wss) anymore.
