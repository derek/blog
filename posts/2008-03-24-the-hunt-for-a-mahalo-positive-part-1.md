  content: "Thanks for taking the time to do this! This is a great format... I'm holding
    my breath watching. \r\n\r\nSome real time feedback: \r\n\r\n1. Yes, mix between
    search engine, wikipedia, and DMOZ. \r\n\r\n2. Just because something hasn't worked
    in the past (DMOZ/Yahoo) doesn't mean it won't work in the future. \r\n\r\n3.
    Google did not say we were spam--SEO book made a deceptive headline to stir the
    post obviously. Also, as you mention the best computer speakers was a test type
    page... it's not representative of the entire site. \r\n\r\n4. Yes, Mahalo works
    best for short searches. Kind of the opposite of Google/Yahoo where the more you
    type in the better the result. our goal is not to do long-term searches. \r\n\r\n5.
    Yes, the tabbed search is amazing! \r\n\r\n6. We actually have 40,000+ pages so
    far.... we're adding 1,000+ per week.\r\n\r\n7. Keep in mind that we do need to
    have the basic wikipedia page, official page on our SERP even if you don't need
    it. some folks coming to that page might not know the obvious sites. So, as you
    say the UOK could be useful for a general surfer, not an expert right now. \r\n\r\n8.
    Keep in mind that many of these pages like University of Kansas are probably 50-70%
    complete right now... they will take 1-3 years each to get to 80-90% completed.
    It's a similar process to Wikipedia. \r\n\r\n9. The Web Development page is a
    \"user generated stub\" which means the users are building it out right now. Very
    cool that you found it! What you see is a collection of links like Delicious or
    StumbleUpon. When this page grows to 20-30 links we will build it out. So, you
    found an in progress page... which has some solid links which is encouraging.
    \r\n\r\n10. Good feedback for Scoble on how to format his videos... he should
    start with an overview of the site. send that to Robert. :-)\r\n\r\n11. Regarding
    Jason Calacanis News &amp; Gossip vs. Jason Calacanis it's actually one page with
    sections. if you type in a section it will jump to that section. \r\n\r\n12. Recent
    tweets is a GREAT idea! Thanks for that. \r\n\r\nCouple of things to check out:\r\n\r\na)
    How to articles... type \"how to\" and look at the drop down. great stuff. \r\nb)
    Click on all the category pages and you'll find great stuff\r\nc) click on the
    headlines of the top of the page. we do a really good job on breaking news stories
    right now. in fact, just type in any person of note in the news today (Barack,
    HIllary, Spitzer, etc). \r\n\r\nThanks again for this.... I wish more folks who
    are critical would actually take the time to look at the site! Really great job
    on the video. The entire team is watching the video and taking notes. \r\n\r\nIf
    you keep this up I'm gonna owe you one heck of a steak dinner! \r\n\r\nbest j"

  content: Trying to understand the barriers to entry and why this is special? Aren't
    there tons of human edited directory's? My understanding is the issue isn't first
    time inclusion of a few thousand sites (or few hundred thousand if you have a
    big team) - it's reaching critical mass and ensuring the quality of already included
    sites (which suddenly change from an amazing help site to a casino / adult site?)

  content: "Derek,\r\n\r\nAs Jason already said we really appreciate when anyone takes
    the time to create something like this. In response we have made a few updates
    based on your feedback.\r\n\r\n1. iSight http://www.mahalo.com/ISight\r\n\r\nWorking
    to improve this page and include links for related software. Additionally we have
    tasked out Greenhouse (our remote workers) to create a page for \"Webcam Software\"
    in general. You can see that page being built at http://greenhouse.mahalo.com/Webcam_Software.
    This will be in the Mahalo index by the end of today.\r\n\r\n2. Kansas State Basketball
    \r\n\r\nThis page appeared to have a redirect issue which has now been corrected.
    \r\n\r\n3. University of Kansas State http://www.mahalo.com/University_of_Kansas\r\n\r\nWe
    are working on this page now to improve it's content for future visitors.\r\n\r\n4.
    Web Development and Jason Calacanis Recent Tweets\r\n\r\nBoth of these pages are
    UGS (user generated stubs) which is why they were both light on content. Web development
    is a great term which is going to get built out right now. Please check http://www.mahalo.com/Web_Development
    again later today.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the great feedback, look forward to
    seeing part 2.\r\nSean Percival"

  content: "I just wanted to add that I viewed your video and appreciate when someone
    will take the time to really check out what they write about in their blog.  So
    often a blogger will take a quick glance and write on that brief impression.  I
    work for Mahalo and work very hard to build pages full of relevant links, and
    to find those rare \"diamonds in the rough\" links that the normal surfer would
    miss. That is the ultimate thrill. They are out there, though rare!\r\n\r\nIt's
    okay that you don't think we're the best thing since sliced bread because Mahalo
    isn't really targeted at you or other techno-savvy young people. However,  I can
    see school kids of all ages, even college age, using Mahalo as a great place to
    gather info on papers etc. Check out our literature section. I think it's particularily
    good.\r\n\r\nNow, if I were to critique your site, I would not be able to say
    much good because you don't write about the things that I need to find online.
    \ My son is a computer nerd. I need to ask him to review your site. \r\n\r\nThere
    are a lot of people out there and a lot of sites on the net. There is a niche
    where most sites fit. The trick is to determine your niche and speak to it and
    not get caught up in trying to speak to everyone. It can't be done!!\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I do like your post about Mahalo and look forward to the rest of them. Keep up
    the good work you do for your readers.\r\n\r\nMary1440\r\nwww.revealedreflections.com"

  content: "Reverse disclaimer (claimer?): I have no connection to Mahalo. I'm not
    even a fanboy. I'm just warming up to the site's philosophy, thanks partly to
    Calacanis's \"social media\" tour.\r\nA few notes. Just because.\r\n\r\nWhat I
    kind of like about Mahalo (resounding endorsement):\r\n*   vetted (getting tired
    of misleading and commercial results elsewhere)\r\n*   \"all-in-one\" (see basic
    info as well as links)\r\n*   Mahalo Follow (link submission tool)\r\n*   incremental
    search everywhere\r\n*   directory approach but tagging/folksonomy (what Yahoo!
    was missing in '95)\r\n*   team's responsiveness\r\n*   simple visuals for featured
    results\r\n\r\nWhat I think could be added:\r\n*   info about page's \"maturity\"/completeness\r\n*
    \  link differentiation through visuals (for official, user-submitted...)\r\n*
    \  allow users to save copies of pages (Plum-like)\r\n*   thesaurus-like massaging
    search (like alternative spelling in\r\n    Google, \"did you mean\")\r\n*   basic
    homepage customization (not portal-like, just toned down)\r\n\r\nSome ideas to
    discuss:\r\n*   search+directory+encyclopedia yes, but also guide (about.com)\r\n*
    \  and social bookmarking (Plum, Ma.gnolia, Spurl...)\r\n*   what is the real
    difference between content and links?"

  content: "Derek, I came across your blog from Jason's blog.  Im sorry to say that
    after watching your video you really just come off as a hater.  Mahalo isn't for
    everyone and apparently not for you.  I don't use it personally, but my grandmother
    has been able to find all the info she has ever wanted on it.\r\n\r\nMahalo is
    not meant to replace google which you give the impression your expecting it to
    do.  You complain of links, links, links...well what do you think google is?  Mahalo
    is afterall a SEARCH ENGINE, not an encyclopedia."

  content: "I think the biggest problem with Mahalo is that it feels like a 'Mashup'.
    It's not one thing, rather it has elements of social network, directory, meta
    search, wikipedia, about.com, yahoo answers, live news, iptv ??? etc... But it
    doesn't really nail any of these areas.\r\n\r\nI think Jason is really just throwing
    every piece of web 1.0/2.0 he can think of against the wall and trying to get
    one piece to stick. It is hard to criticise because if you say it's a bad search
    engine someone else will say no it's a directory. If you say it's a bad 'how to'
    guide they will say it's a search engine !\r\n\r\nOne bit of Mahalo that is interesting
    is the 'how-to' guides:\r\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/Category:How_To\r\nIf Mahalo
    was the 'how to' search engine that would go somewhere. Google, wikipedia, yahoo
    answers, about.com : nothing really serves this area well.\r\nThis is where professionally
    written pages would be well received. People want content, not just a list of
    links !"

  content: "@Eric: I think that is the question everyone has.  Why is this special,
    and why does it deserve the hype it is getting?  If it truly were a brand new
    method of searching the internet, then sure.  But, it isn't as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\n@Chris:
    If I were a \"hater\", I would just sit here and complain about the site instead
    of spending hours trying to figure out where it has holes (if any).  I'm a web
    developer full time and a consultant part time.  Figuring out problems like this,
    sadly, is fun.\r\n\r\n@Sam: iShowU.  It's a very cool and simple program.  I think
    the movement of the screen and following the mouse help out considerably in making
    screencasts like this watchable.\r\n\r\n@AC Dead on.  Your post along with Chris's
    really expose the issue with Mahalo.  What the hell is it?\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat comments
    so far everyone!"

After <a href="http://explore.twitter.com/Derek/statuses/694708812" target="_blank">railing</a> on his site enough, I promised Jason Calacanis I'd take a <u>fair</u> look at his latest startup (Mahalo.com) and say something nice about it, well... once I was actually about to find something.  So here's the first video of my experience hunting around Mahalo.com for a "positive" and not just looking at it as <a href="http://blog.derekville.net/2008/03/21/jason-calacanis-and-his-human-powered-spam/" target="_blank">polluting the internet with more spam</a>.

As you can see, the hunt will continue for yet another day.  By the end of the week, I'm determined to at least find <em>something</em>.

P.S. This is my first experience using Viddler and wow... Much nicer than YouTube.  YouTube certainly has its purpose on the internet and I think there is room for both.
