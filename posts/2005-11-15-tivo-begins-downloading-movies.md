This, on top of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4415474.stm">announcing a partnership with Yahoo</a> gives clear indication where TiVo is going.  No longer will living room IPTV be confined to <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> &amp; savvy Windows users, but now it is being delivered to the masses.  The Yahoo partnership allows TiVo users to schedule recordings from  Yahoo's website.  A neat little trick, but that is just the tip of the iceberg on what we can only speculate the end goal is at this point.  Now that you have the ability to schedule recordings remotely, and download video via an internet connection, the possibilities are virtually endless with regards to internet media.  Click a banner or any ordinary link, and seconds later a related file is being sent to your living room all automagically.

TiVo once again appears to have an edge over its cable counterparts, which is something it will need to stay in business as we've already found out.  Could only be a matter of time before the Yahoo &gt; TiVo buyout begins.
