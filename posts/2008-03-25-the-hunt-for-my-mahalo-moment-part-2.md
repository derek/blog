  content: "1 min in - Yes, we change the home page all day long. Whatever is happening
    on CNN or DrudgeReport will be on our home page.\r\n\r\n3:04 - You keep finding
    user generated stubs! Funny, the high-tech stuff seems to build out by our users.\r\n\r\n4:12
    - Thanks for the praise on Social Media SERP. \r\n\r\n4:45 - \"internet marketing\"
    is a user stub as well! dang, we keep getting user stubs. You should do a Google
    and Yahoo search to compare these. \r\n\r\n5:50 - that ishop is crappy link. we
    have to balance letting people submit vs. banning the border line stuff. \r\n\r\n6:29
    - we are considering seting the limit to two votes in the future. \r\n\r\n6:55
    - New media... ugh, another user generated stub!\r\n\r\n7:47 - blogger bob!!!
    macbook air, twit, well played! still, not a major news story except on  TWiT.
    ;-)\r\n\r\n10:20 - no, we don't do complex queries right now. one, two word queries
    are best. \r\n\r\n11 - yes, discovery is a great process. we can guide folks to
    100% spam free results. \r\n\r\nCan't wait for tomorrow.... do some single word
    searchs. like top 10,000 searches. \r\n\r\nbest jason"

  content: I watched a presentation for Mahalo done by Jason in Paris some time ago.
    I was really struck by some of his ideas and became interested in Social Media.
    As a novice I've had a hard time figuring out Mahalo and I hope your series will
    shed some light for me. Thanks.

    want to believe but I just can't see it.\r\nHonestly I am a heathen and I need
    enlightenment. Please!!"

The journey continues...

So, I think I have a pretty good idea of what Mahalo can/can't do at this point and I have a theory as to why the 'TechCrunch 100,000' (as Jason calls us) have such a problem with the site.  That's a post for later though.
