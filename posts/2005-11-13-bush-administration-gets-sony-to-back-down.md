Two announcements today....
- <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/archive/2005/11/12/414299.aspx">Microsoft will treat & remove the Sony/XCP rootkit like the malware that it is.</a>
- <a href="http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/5002/admonish.html">Bush Administration to Sony: It's your intellectual property -- it's not your computer.</a>

When you have both the Bush administration & Microsoft telling you your latest shenanigans are up to no good.... that's saying something.
