I sent an email at to the buzz last week saying they should select me for one of the male contestants for the prom court, and got a call yesterday telling me I'm in!  I guess they are going to call me Monday (the 27th) during the morning show (9:10 AM) to do some sort of an interview or something, the woman didn't really know what exactly was going on.

From what I gather about the "prom court", they take a handful of guys and some girls too, put them in a bracket where they face off against one another.  The winners are announced prom king &amp; queen.

Here we go!
