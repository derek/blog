Over the past week, I had the pleasure of seeing two documentaries exposing two cultures in American society rarely seen up close, "[Born Rich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342143/)" and "[Devil's Playground](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293088/)".

Produced by 21 year old Jamie Johnson of the Johnson &amp; Johnson family, "Born Rich" was a look into the lives of himself and his peers, a handful of the heirs and heiresses of Americas wealth.  By watching, it's clear that Johnson doesn't have much experience making films, but that didn't detract from the film and the courage it took for a kid of his background to make a film solely about the wealth of his peers.  In their culture, Jamie's dad says that money is a taboo subject to be discussed publicly and reiterates over and over that he is not comfortable with his son making a film of this nature.  The family lawyer also recommends he not make this film as well.  But still... he rounds up a dozen or so of the nations wealthiest youth and grills them on a variety of questions ranging from their aspirations in life to their fears of being cut out of their inheritance.

Only a few come out showing some redeeming qualities (Ivanka Trump being one of them).  But there were a few others who fit the stereotype of rich, pompous, and whiny.  Not surprising Luke Weil tried (unsuccessfully) to sue Johnson to block the release of this film.  Maybe if he hadn't gloated about his money and said things like...  "Fuck you. I'm from New York... My family could buy your family. Piss off." or talking about only helping beggars just to get them away, he might not have worried about the film being released.   The security of being rich is of course attractive, but some of these kids showcase the fact that when you know nothing but money, you are completely oblivious to reality.

On the completely other-side of the cultural spectrum, "Devil's Playground" is a look into the Amish lifestyle in America, specifically, the teenagers experience during "Rumspringa."  In brief, the Amish believe that you shouldn't be born into religion or have it forced on you, rather you should decide to accept it yourself.  When an Amish teen turns 16, he/she is free to do whatever they choose, they are free from the confines of a strict Amish lifestyle.  Now picture yourself, 15 years old, living in rural Indiana, never having any of the things we take for granted in our busy (sub)urban lives, and boom... you turn 16, free to do whatever you want.  Free to experience all the temptations of drugs, alcohol, sex, etc...  You might not think it would be easy to find drugs in an Amish community, but this film follows Faron, an 18 year old drug dealer/meth addict struggling in his decision to commit to the church.  Basically, the night you turn 16, you have a party and drinks are pushed on you until you puke (not too different from the average 21 year old's birthday).  Because Amish children typically only attend school until 8th grade, at 16, you are living with you parents, with no real responsibilities (unless you work), so them being unleashed and thrown into the world is just like when a home-schooled kid goes off to college.  It's a disaster waiting to happen.

The revelation that stuck me from watching these two films is that they really show happiness is only a state of mind and that money has nothing to do with it.  Both groups, one being poor, and the other being the rich, have roughly the same percentage in their groups who are miserable, lost, and confused.
