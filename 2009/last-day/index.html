<div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s my last day at Catholic Content.  It&rsquo;s been a great 3 year ride and is certainly going out with a bang.  When we started planning for NCYC 2009 (National Catholic Youth Conference) 18 months ago, I never would have guessed it would be my last weekend.  But here I am, working behind the scenes with the production crew to stream the event out to thousands of people around the world.  The fun part? I&rsquo;ve never done live event streaming before, so it&rsquo;s been a hectic, but adventurous weekend.  In a way, it&rsquo;s almost a culmination of the last three years.  Lots of stuff I&rsquo;ve never done before, but having a blast learning.</p>

<p>Coming into this job as the lead developer for MyCatholicVoice.com, I had zero experience running a project the size of where we have taken this.  I had never built a web server this size from scratch (software-wise).  But along the way, I&rsquo;ve had to tackle hundreds, or heck&hellip; likely thousands of problems along the way, and I&rsquo;ve learned something at every step.  It&rsquo;s been such an incredible learning experience as I&rsquo;ve gained a bit of knowledge about so many different areas.  These new skills include everything from cloud computing, systems architecture, to Linux administration, all the way to the front-end with JavaScript libraries.  Then of course, that middle layer of PHP where my skills and knowledge have improved an unmeasurable amount.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-594"></a>
When I started my career after graduation 5 years ago, I had a gameplan, a very iterative gameplan:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Get a job, anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Find a web development job, maybe it would be something that I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about or didn&#8217;t pay well, but it was at least enough to get me in the door as a programmer. </li>
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Find a job that paid a decent amount, but didn&#8217;t have to be a project I was passionate about.  </li>
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now that everything else is taken care of, find a project I was passionate about. </li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond those 4 steps, I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly what came next.  Perhaps it was starting my own company? Maybe moving out to the west coast?  Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t even in web development?  In fact, mid-step 3, I considered changing careers because my job was just so unfulfilling.  I enjoy cooking, so maybe Culinary school? Then I remembered I don&rsquo;t like anything outside 10 foods, so nevermind that.  I loved doing <a href="http://www.derekville.net/2005/06/06/high-school-animation-projects/">3D animations in high school</a>, but never pursued it because I can&rsquo;t draw.  So&hellip; I stuck it out and realized it was just my job, not my career choice, that was unsatisfying.  Boom.  Reenergized.</p>

<p>Well, tomorrow is the transition between from Step 4 to Step 5. This year I realized the next step for me was going to be moving to LA, SF, or Seattle.  I needed to get to a tech hub where there were thousands of jobs, with companies large &amp; small.  But, there was also something from this last step that I was missing, that &ldquo;passionate about the project&rdquo; part.  While I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the platform we&rsquo;ve built at MyCatholicVoice, I&rsquo;ve never been able to have much of a connection with our users.  Why?  I&rsquo;m a non-Catholic working on a Catholic project.  While I think the purpose of the project is a noble one and I agree with bringing &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; to the Catholic church, it ultimately doesn&rsquo;t effect me faith-wise.  That&rsquo;s a little bit of a bummer sometimes.  I want to be a user of the product, as well as a developer.</p>

<p>Well, enter Yahoo. Talking about being a user of a product&hellip; Y! is one of the oldest services I still use from my first days on the internet in the mid-90s.  Check out my <a href="http://www.derekville.net/2009/11/13/onward-and-upward/">last post</a> for all the reasons I&rsquo;m thrilled to have this opportunity.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s after what&rsquo;s next? Hmmm&hellip;.</p>
