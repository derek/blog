<ul>
<li><p><strong>2003</strong> - Miami Football players make the brilliant decision to record a rap song (<a href="http://media.putfile.com/7th-Floor-Crew" target="_blank">Streaming</a>, <a href="http://web.naplesnews.com/05/11/uofmiami111705.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP3</a>) glamorizing gang bangin’ bizzatches, or as one member of the 7th Floor Crew so delicately put it, “We ‘bout to run a seven-man train all up in you.” I especially liked the reference to having sex with someone’s ear.  <a href="http://www.bonitanews.com/news/2005/nov/18/explicit_content_warning_excerpts_7th_floor_crew_s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyric Excerpts</a></p>

<li><p><strong>2003 - 2005</strong> - UM campus has good laugh, knowledge of this doesn’t spread much further.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>11/05 </strong>- 19 yr old UM student &amp; blogger Kyle Munzenrieder wants something to post on his blog and decides this song would be a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>11/18/05</strong> - ESPN.com <a href="http://miamity.com/2005/diary/espncom-manages-to-manufacture-a-scandal/" target="_blank">“Manufactures scandal”</a> with an article entitled “<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=2226626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rap recording could threaten Miami’s progress</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Muzenrieder takes down post at the request of the university, but audio file &amp; other blog posts are already out there.  Too late UM, sorry.  Welcome to the internet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>11/17/05</strong> - After recieving threats from UM football fans, Muzenrieder posts a fake suicide note.  Cops show up, take him to dean’s office where a hilarious conversation ensued…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/breaking_news/13247630.htm" target="_blank">Article</a></p>
<blockquote>It was a good-sized office, with room for what seemed like an awful lot of people. It had a side door, which was closed, and – rather disconcertingly – a photograph of UM football coach Larry Coker on the desk.<br><br>‘’Suicide isn’t funny,’’ Sandler said. Munzenrieder agreed that suicide isn’t funny, and that it was stupid of him to have made the post.<br><br>But, the 19-year-old noted, just that morning he’d taken two tests, in Computer Science and Ethics in Media. ‘’If I was going to do it,’’ said Munzenrieder, <code>there&#39;s no way I would have taken two tests today.&#39;&#39;

That argument, like most he made that day, didn&#39;t go over well.

Sandler told him, &#39;&#39;I have the power to decide whether or not you go to school here anymore.&#39;&#39; Munzenrieder was advised to withdraw from school. The dean called his parents in Naples and told his father that</code>your son has caused a big headache for the administration here.’’<br><br>At some point, a psychologist emerged from the side door. ‘’I think you should go home,’’ she said.<br><br>‘’For how long?’’ Munzenrieder asked, seeing his college career flittering away. <code>What does that mean?&#39;&#39;</code>I don’t know. What do you think it means?’’<br><br><code></code>I think it means you don’t know.’’<br><br>‘’Stop double-talking me,’’ she said.</blockquote>

<li><strong>11/17/05</strong> - Kyle sums up his day with a post titled “<a href="http://miamity.com/2005/diary/a-run-down-of-the-best-day-of-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Run Down Of The Best Day Of My Life</a>“ which includes this nugget of wisdom…<blockquote><br>I’m on the phone with my sister and I’m glad to know that at the young age of 14 she realizes what most people never do: “A lot of people are morons”. Of course most people never realize this because they are morons.</blockquote>

<p>Kyle has since been removed from the dorm and it living in a hotel.  He will only be allowed back for the spring semester upon completing a “psychiatric evaluation” by the UM medical staff which I am sure will deem him “unfit to continue studies at UM.”</p>
<p>Bottom line is the Miami administration just doesn’t get it.  How is Kyle any more responsible for this than Pat Forde?  The players were the ones creating the story &amp; distributed the song.  Kyle reported on this story two years after the fact, and then Forde reported on that story.  Forde was the one who brought the “headache” to the school’s administration, not Kyle.  There was no controversy until Forde created one, everyone just thought it was funny.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Forde’s article was about how the Miami football team had successfully transformed their old image of “Thug U” into a rather clean one and how that apparently was all thrown away with this creation of this song.  Well Pat, sorry, looks like you were wrong.  There are still thugs at UM, they just don’t play football.</p>
<p>Good luck Kyle.</p>
