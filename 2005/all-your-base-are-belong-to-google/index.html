It appears to be <a href="http://base.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Base</a>.  It hasn’t officially launched yet, so those services are merely speculation.  However, the likes of those services has been <a href="http://ebaystrategies.blogs.com/ebay_strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the buzz</a> lately.</p>
<p>Now it is becoming more clear as to why EBay bought Skype, because Google now has everything EBay has (and a ton more).  They will both have VoIP (GoogleTalk &amp; Skype), Auctions (Base &amp; Ebay), Classifieds (Base &amp; Craigslist which Ebay owns part of/Half.com), and a payment system (Paypal &amp; soon to be released Google Wallet).</p>
<p>The difference between the two?  Google = free.  As long as Google has eyeballs looking at their ads, they’ll release every one of their products for free.  Base won’t need it’s own revenue stream.  Ebay on the other hand has no revenue stream if they don’t charge for postings.</p>
<p>This should also be interesting with the hyped <a href="http://calendar.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Calendar</a> that was talked about months ago that still has yet to launch.  Base will have events, so… log in and Calendar them.  They will likely also be sending out RSS feeds for listings, so…. throw them in the recently launched <a href="www.google.com/reader">RSS Reader</a>.  Want to talk to a listing poster?  <a href="www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> or <a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMail </a>‘em.  Then of course… want another product like the one you are looking at?  Look on the right side of the screen for those “Ads by Google.”</p>
<p>The next few should be a huge couple months for Google.  Now that they have pretty much all the basic services, time to kick it in full gear.  Next up… Google’s entry into media (<a href="http://video.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Video</a> is just the beginning), Google Office, Google WiFi, GMail 2.0 (they are about to be killed by Yahoo &amp; Microsoft’s new email apps), Google Online (after they buy AOL &amp; give away internet access) &amp; then the king of them all… Google OS, your new web based operating system that can run from any computer in the world.</p>
<p>Meet your new Overlord.</p>
