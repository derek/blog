Well, I just upgraded from Wordpress 2 to 2.3 and MySQL from 4 to 5, so this is mostly just a test. Oh, and the theme I was using doesn't play well with WP 2.3's tags, so I'll have to work on getting another one up. In the meantime, you guys get "Default". Be excited.  I've also scrapped the categories for the most part in favor of tags as that structure makes more sense to me.  I'll work on rebuilding the both over the next couple days.  I can't believe it took Wordpress this frickin' long to introduce tags.  Yeesh.
