    All the kitties are all for you TJ considering how much you like them.

    I use Pinnacle Studio.  Good for small projects like these, but blows for large projects.  It's taken me over a year to get a Spring Break DVD finished because of how much the program crashes and out of sync audio.  Adobe Premiere might be a better choice for larger projects.

Ok, so this really hasn't evolved into a "video blog" in the traditional sense, rather, it is just me throwing up a bunch of edited clips that I have stored in random places on my computer from weeks, months, and years ago.  If you want a real video blog, check out <a href="http://stevegarfield.blogs.com/videoblog/">here</a>, <a href="http://philham.blogspot.com/">here</a>, and <a href="http://jordanmakesvideos.blogspot.com/2005/05/i-will-love-you-forever.html">here</a> for a couple.  In the meantime... this one goes out to Heather and Justin who are living with a rather fat Stormy now.  This was shot back when Stormy was a wee little kitten a bit over a year ago.  So guys, at least you can look back on this video and remember the time when he weighed no more than a bag of catnip.  The opponent in this battle royale is MonkeyPox, King of the stubby butt species of chimps.

Why "My Coco" as the background music?  It was a request.  Also, no more puppy/kitten videos, I just had to at least get these ones up here.
