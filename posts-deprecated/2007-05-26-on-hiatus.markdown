No, I haven't dissapeared, just haven't felt much like writing.  But a quick update over the last 6 months, I've moved into my new loft in Kansas City's River Market District, and absolutely loving it.  I'm also going to be starting a new job in the next couple weeks working as a developer for a new website that will hopefully launch in about 6 months, and couldn't be more excited!

Until we meet again. =)
