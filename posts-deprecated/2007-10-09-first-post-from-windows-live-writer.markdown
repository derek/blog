<p><a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/writer_screenshot.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="189" alt="microsoft writerscreenshot" src="http://www.derekgathright.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/writer_screenshot_thumb.jpg" width="179" border="0"/></a></p> <p>One of the reasons why I don't find myself blogging too much is I think I'm just too lazy sometimes to go to my site, log in, go to the post page, use a crappy WSYWIG to create the blog entry, and hit post. Not a lengthy process, but one I get annoyed with. But I just came across <a href="http://get.live.com/betas/writer_betas" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a>, which is a Microsoft desktop app that hooks into your Spaces, Wordpress, Blogger, Livejournal, etc... blog and allows you to create a post in a very rich and intuitive interface. The biggest surprise is that it actually downloads the CSS sheet and mimics what your post will look like while you are editing it!</p> <p><a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/writer_screenshot_derek.jpg"><img id="id" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="writer_screenshot_derek" src="http://www.derekgathright.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/writer_screenshot_derek_thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0"/></a></p> <p>So, props to Microsoft for coming out with a pretty slick app, and especially allowing users to connect it to something other than their Spaces blog, which no one has.</p> <p>Alright, gotta post this to see what it looks like.</p>
