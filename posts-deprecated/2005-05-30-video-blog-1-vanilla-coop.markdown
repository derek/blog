To kick off my new video blog, I bring you.... Vanilla Coop.   In college, a buddy of mine, Cooper, made a career out of gettin' funky to Ice, Ice, Baby whenever it happened to be played at parties.  One night last fall, it came up next on the playlist, I grabbed my camera, and this is what I got.  Enjoy.
