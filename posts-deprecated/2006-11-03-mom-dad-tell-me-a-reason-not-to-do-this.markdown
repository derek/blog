So I've been hearing these ads on <a target="_blank" title="96.5 The Buzz" href="http://www.965thebuzz.com/">96.5 The Buzz</a> recently for these new condominiums in downtown Kansas City, just a few blocks from where I currently live.  I've been looking at condos recently, but not seriously considering buying one as I love my current loft, however, after checking out this new condo development, <a title="The Manhatten - Kansas City" href="http://www.themanhattankc.com/home/home.asp">The Manhattan - Kansas City</a>, I fell in love with them immediately.  upon walking out, I asked my parents to give me a reason not to buy one, and the only answer they had was... "We can't, and we think you should."

<a target="_blank" title="The Manhattan" href="http://www.themanhattankc.com/home/home.asp">The Manhattan</a> has great prices (much cheaper than <a target="_blank" title="The Metropolitan Condominiums" href="http://www.metropolitancondo.com/">The Metropolitan</a>, which is just next door), the amenities are outstanding, and best of all, the lifestyle that it's developer, Matt Abbott, is trying to create appears to be one of a kind with amenities like these:
<ul>
	<li>Granite counter-tops are standard in both the</li>
	<li>kitchen and bath areas</li>
	<li>5 Â¼ inch crown molding and baseboards are standard</li>
	<li>Italian travertine tile is standard in all the wet areas</li>
	<li>All new stainless steel appliances</li>
	<li>Stainless gas range cook-top</li>
	<li>All new custom cabinetry</li>
	<li>Updated plumbing and electrical in every unit</li>
	<li>Built in wine rack in every unit</li>
	<li>24/7 Concierge</li>
	<li>On site property management</li>
	<li>Limousine service for all residents</li>
	<li>Secured building access</li>
	<li>Penthouse pool and lounge</li>
	<li>Full fitness facility</li>
	<li>Secured parking</li>
	<li>25yr. Tax Abatement</li>
</ul>
I'm looking at moving in either late-December or January.  It just depends on how much I want to customize my layout & design.
