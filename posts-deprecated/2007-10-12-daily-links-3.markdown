	<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/12/gore.politics/" target="_blank">Gore awarded with Nobel Peace Prize</a> - Maybe history will look back 50 years from now and see that it was better he didn't win in 2000 considering the good he's done for climate awareness.  Will this put the pressure on him to run in '08?</li>

I respect the men and women of our country who are over there fighting. It is an unbelievably selfless thing to do.
