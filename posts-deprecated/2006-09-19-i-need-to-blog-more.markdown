I know, I know.  I honestly have lots of topics brewing through my head, they just haven't congealed enough yet to write about.  Topics include; New media, YouTube, my insane amount of concerts coming up, an based based MP3-collection interface I am building, my triumphant return return to NetFlix, Jayhawks football, and as all bloggers do... politics.

So my goal will be to write at least one good post per week.  It's not a ton, but it's a good start compared to where I am at right now.
