    Hell yeah I have it.  I paid good money for that shot.

    So yeah, you can use it, as long as I get royalties. :p

    Amazingly enough my hair looks very similar to what it does in that picture, minus the awesome bowl cut.

    The 90s rocked.

Ok, now I feel a bit girly with back to back posts about kittens and puppies, but I came across <a href="http://bobcatandlynx.com/">this site</a> the other day and realized exotic cats are the coolest pets ever.  Even if you don't like cats because they are wimpy and boring, how about a cat that weights 100 lbs and lives 35 years?  That manly enough for ya?  To add on a little more testosterone... apparently the best thing to feed them is raw meat.  While it might get expensive giving them a KC strip every day, you at least get a bit of satisfaction out of it by owning a pet that you have to throw a slab of meat down on the ground and watch it go to town rather than feeding it a can of wimpy cat food.

Clawing your face off versus owning the coolest pet ever?  Easy choice, get the cat.  Maybe I'll get a <a href="http://www.eriksaunders.com/images/liger.jpg">Liger</a> to play with my new bobcat.

"So what if I don't have any ears, you know how many chicks I get?!?"

 I call this guy Simba.

This is what they can turn into



This also reminds me of the time at Rockfest '96, probably in between Rollin's Band and Sammy Hagar, I think I paid $20 to play with this baby bengal tiger and have my picture taken.

Tamra, me, & TJ.  God my hair was so awesome back then.
