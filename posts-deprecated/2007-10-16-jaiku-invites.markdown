Anyone have any invites to <a href="http://jaiku.com/" target="_blank">Jaiku</a> they want to give me?  If so, hit me up at drgath at gmail.

I've always thought the "life-stream" concept first pioneered by Twitter and now used by Jaiku was pretty cool even though I haven't used Twitter as much as I should.  Now that <a href="http://jaiku.com/help/google" target="_blank">Google owns Jaiku</a>, I'm sure it's going to turn into a very cool product and be pretty <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/wireless/phones/2007-10-14-google-phone_N.htm" target="_blank">integral to the GPhone OS</a> someday.
