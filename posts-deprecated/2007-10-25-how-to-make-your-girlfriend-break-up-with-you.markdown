<img src="http://www.derekgathright.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/spacevestgi4.jpg" style="border-width: 0px" alt="SpaceVestGI" border="0" height="190" width="240" />
<blockquote style="clear: both">"The gaming peripheral will consist of eight zones, all of which will be able to direct appropriate force to accurately simulate a plethora of sensations, including bullet fire, explosions, punches and even finger taps."</blockquote>
Now you can strap on your vest, throw on your helmet, and soon enough you won't have to worry about your girlfriend bitching at you to take out the trash considering she'll run far far away when you bring this home.
