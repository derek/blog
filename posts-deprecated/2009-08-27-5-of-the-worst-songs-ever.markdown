So a co-worker of mine introduced me to Shakira's "She Wolf" song today, and wow is it horrid.  It got me thinking... What other awful songs are out there polluting the pop charts?  Well, here's 5 that are probably somewhere in my top 50.  Maybe someday I'll post the other 45.

<h2>#1 Shakira - She Wolf (2009)</h2>
<p>I can't help but crack up everytime the chorus kicks in, it's just horrible.  And the "Ah-ooooo" 1:35 into the song? What hack producer though that was a good touch?</p>

<h2>#2 Black Eyed Peas - I Gotta Feelin' (2009)</h2>
<p>This song is such a crock of shit.  Not that I expected amazingly creative lyrics from the Black Eyed Peas, but c'mon, this song isn't even trying.  Here's a great review from Cracked.com, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/video_17618_black-eyed-peas-have-officially-written-worst-song-ever.html">Black Eyed Peas Have Officially Written The Worst Song Ever</a></p>

<h2>#3 Rednex - Cotton Eye Joe (1995)</h2>
<p>Whoever the hell though mixing techno and country would be a good idea needs to be shot.  Oh, and don't forget about the group's chartbusting 2002 follow-up, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDdlHmzIdn8">Cotton Eye Joe 2002</a></p>

<h2>#4 Toby Keith - The Angry American (2002)</h2>
<p>On the topic of rednecks... </p>
<p>Outraged by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Toby Keith enlisted in the Air Force — no, sorry, he wrote a fight anthem so vengeful, it makes “The Star-Spangled Banner” sound like “Give Peace a Chance.” Though right-wing radio hosts and politicians called him a hero, Keith (who hadn’t had a hit in years) moaned, “It sucks ass that I have to defend myself for being patriotic.” Wrong. You have to defend yourself for celebrating violence and bloodlust.</p>

<h2>#5 - Billy Ray Cyrus - Achy Breaky Heart (1991)</h2>
<p>As if line-dancing really needed a comeback.  This is a song that gets stuck in your head, and won't leave for at least a couple days.  So go ahead, click the image, I dare you.</p>
