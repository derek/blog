I started out just wanting to allow people to send me text messages via the side bar of this blog and got it working (with PHP) in about 2 minutes, but then I thought… “It works, but I hate reloading the page for something so simple.”  That’s when AJAX popped in my head and it seemed like a great first script.</p>
<p>So off I went to grab the latest version of <a href="http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAJAX</a> (Simple Ajax), and boy were they right about the “simple” part.  Within about 30 minutes, I had a functional script that you can now find on the side bar.  Before you try it out, please use the <a href="http://www.derekgathright.com/ajax_send_mail.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo page</a>, as I don’t need everyone sending me text messages just to see how it works.</p></div><a href="/blog/2005/first-ajax-script/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2005/elephant/" class="post-title-link">Elephant</a></h2><div class="post-info">May 28, 2005</div><div class="post-content"><div style="float:left"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wpsaba9.jpg" height="400" style="margin-right:1em; padding-top:5px;"></div>

<p>Having just finished watching the controversial film, “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363589/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elephant</a>“, I’ll have to say that it was a very good, and also a rather haunting movie in which people will either love or hate.  Some say this movie was Gus Van Sant attempting to portray the Columbine shootings, however I believe it is fairly obvious when watching the movie that it is was more inspired by Columbine <u>as well as</u> all the other high school shootings in recent years.   Those were events that really engrained the reality and trauma some kids endure throughout high school, and the actions they can sometimes take.</p></div><a href="/blog/2005/elephant/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2005/how-not-to-handle-hollywood-success/" class="post-title-link">How Not to Handle Hollywood Success</a></h2><div class="post-info">May 28, 2005</div><div class="post-content"><div style="float:left"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KpxPS1W.jpg" height="400" style="margin-right:1em; padding-top:5px;"></div>

<p>I just finished watching the documentary “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390336/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overnight</a>“, featuring Troy Duffy’s overnight rise and fall in Hollywood.  If you don’t recognize the name, he was writer and director of the cult hit “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boondock Saints</a>“.  Boondock really was an entertaining movie and from what I understand has had rather impressive DVD sales for being a low budget independent film.  The sequel has “been in production” for quite some time, but likely won’t ever be made.</p></div><a href="/blog/2005/how-not-to-handle-hollywood-success/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2005/fun-with-google-maps/" class="post-title-link">Fun with Google Maps</a></h2><div class="post-info">May 15, 2005</div><div class="post-content"><p>It’s amazing how you can waste hours of your day playing around with the brand new Google satellite maps.

<p>Over the past week, I had the pleasure of seeing two documentaries exposing two cultures in American society rarely seen up close, “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Born Rich</a>“ and “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293088/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devil’s Playground</a>“.</p>
<p>Produced by 21 year old Jamie Johnson of the Johnson &amp; Johnson family, “Born Rich” was a look into the lives of himself and his peers, a handful of the heirs and heiresses of Americas wealth.  By watching, it’s clear that Johnson doesn’t have much experience making films, but that didn’t detract from the film and the courage it took for a kid of his background to make a film solely about the wealth of his peers.  In their culture, Jamie’s dad says that money is a taboo subject to be discussed publicly and reiterates over and over that he is not comfortable with his son making a film of this nature.  The family lawyer also recommends he not make this film as well.  But still… he rounds up a dozen or so of the nations wealthiest youth and grills them on a variety of questions ranging from their aspirations in life to their fears of being cut out of their inheritance.</p></div><a href="/blog/2005/a-look-at-two-cultures-rarely-seen/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2005/blast-from-the-past/" class="post-title-link">Blast from the Past</a></h2><div class="post-info">May 8, 2005</div><div class="post-content"></div><a href="/blog/2005/blast-from-the-past/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2005/kicking-off-another-blog/" class="post-title-link">Kicking Off Another Blog</a></h2><div class="post-info">Apr 9, 2005</div><div class="post-content"><p>Going on a 5th incarnation of my personal blog, I think I might actually stick with this one as opposed to the others that I’ve tried.  I tried <a href="https://www.phpnuke.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP-Nuke</a>, but didn’t have use for 99% of their capabilities.  Plus, I don’t need a whole CMS for a simple blog.  As a PHP developer, I tried writing my own, but seemed like too much effort for something I didn’t even know if I’d end up using.  Then, I went against my programmer roots and went with <em>gasp</em>… a hosted blog.  But as I assumed, the lack of control killed it for me.  Since I have plenty of experience managing my own Windows and Linux servers, going with someone else to host my blog just wasn’t going to fly.  So here we are, I just discovered <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> and am fairly happy with it so far.  Installation was a breeze and the interface is great, so it’s easy to understand why this is becoming one of the more popular blog platforms out there.<br></div><a href="/blog/2005/kicking-off-another-blog/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li></ul></main><footer><div class="paginator"><a href="/blog/page/4/" class="prev">PREV</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2005 - 2018 <a href="http://derek.io/blog">Derek Gathright</a>, powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank">hexo-theme-apollo</a>.</p></div></footer></div><script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create',"UA-51709-19",'auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
